# Classification With LLM

## Auto optimize system prompt and for adding few shot examples.

We use adalflow to optimize the system prompt and few shot examples for classification task.
It can help accelerate to a better prompt for your classification task.

## Fine-tune GPT-4o-mini

We fine-tune GPT-4o-mini on the training dataset generated in the first notebook ðŸ‘†
We significantly improve the performance of the model on the classification task.
