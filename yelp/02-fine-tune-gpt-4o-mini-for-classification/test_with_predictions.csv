5,"Food that creates a smile is great food, but food that inspires--that's fantastic food.  The slider truck, although casually camouflaged with a comic theme and serving nothing but sliders, creates great eats that are inspiring for those who love to eat and for those who want to cook.  With the food comes the people, a plethora of individuals that somehow meld together into a friendly mass of hungry fans.  Despite the wait time for excellent sliders the people converse as if they know each other, making the wait seem like a few minutes rather than a bit longer.  I don't mind waiting in line with the cult followers because they are a mixture of artists, parents, students, geeks, photographers, and more.  While waiting in line for the slider truck you get an intelligent conversation in with great people. I love it.\n\nWith the crowd comes the need to feed, and the slider truck delivers wonderful morsels of juicy burger love.  They changed me, turning me into a fan of things I do not normally eat, and that is a feat in itself.  The menu is simple and there are days when they have secret menu items available as well, items that their regulars will wait an hour in line for just to get a taste.  Today it was the french dipper, a roast beef slider with melted cheese, onions and mushroom with a side of au jus.  I tried one and it was to die for--tender, juicy, packed from top to bottom bun and seasoned so well that I wish I ordered four more.  I will definitely dream of that french dipper till the next time it's on the secret menu.  When it comes to turning me, the pulled pork sandwich--one that I refuse to eat ever--became an instant favorite of mine from the slider truck.  It's perfectly cooked and the barbecue sauce is spicy, sweet, and oh so smooth.  That pulled pork is juicy and tender, well seasoned and the sandwich, although slider size, is packed full of it.  The other thing that I hate to eat are jalapenos, but they make a jalapeno jelly that I cannot get enough of on their Captain slider.  I could eat fifty of those burgers with the jalapeno jelly on it.  \n\nWith the mind changing food comes great service.  The owner handles the truck personally, along with three to four of his trusted friends that basically line cook to keep the food coming out fast.  They are all friendly, always smiling and they take extra care to pack everything nicely and with everything you need.  A great touch is the candy that you get with every order, because candy can make anyone smile even on a bad day.\n\nThese sliders are like no other.  They are amazingly filling, great tasting, with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The texture of the patties are perfect, and their sweet rolls that they split into a bun are yummy.  I love the slider truck with all my heart, and they inspired me to try something different every once in awhile.  if you think that this food truck is like others, serving plain food fast and greasy, you have it all wrong.  They serve unique, what I consider gourmet style sliders on the fly. With great prices and service, and the fun crowd and fun times trying to find the truck daily, this is a stop that I'm willing to drive across town to line up for any day of the week.\n\nLine up soon and get your slider fix today, before the food runs out.  The crowds are a plenty, but the specials may not last till you're ready to show up.  That's the fun in this truck--finding it, lining up, talking to people, and then finally eating your addiction.  Get it hot and fast with a smile.  What more could you ask for?  As for myself, nothing.  They are everything that I need when I want my burger fix.\n\nThanks for the inspiration, slider truck.",448147,"Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=ChoiceLogprobs(content=[ChatCompletionTokenLogprob(token='5', bytes=[53], logprob=-4.3202e-07, top_logprobs=[TopLogprob(token='5', bytes=[53], logprob=-4.3202e-07), TopLogprob(token=' five', bytes=[32, 102, 105, 118, 101], logprob=-15.625), TopLogprob(token='4', bytes=[52], logprob=-16.3125), TopLogprob(token=' Five', bytes=[32, 70, 105, 118, 101], logprob=-18.0625)])], refusal=None), message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='5', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))",5,-4.3202e-07

When we arrived, there were 4 other couples in the doorway waiting. We stood there for 10 minutes before someone came to the front. BTW, there is no podium or reception area at the front either) Did they greet us? NO. They took one couple to be seated. At that point, another young couple that was waiting, said to us, \""That's the 2nd couple that's been seated since we arrived half hour ago, and we were here before they were. We're appaled and would rather go elsewhere. Good luck to you.\"" We began to wonder if we should stay. We figured we would wait a while longer. After all, it was Valentines Day, where else are we going to get seated at the last minute?\nAbout 15 minutes went by, and no one came to greet us, and there were 2 empty tables. I walked across the room near the kitchen entrance and told one of the employees we had been waiting over 20 minutes, and no one has even aknowledged our presence, and that we had a reservation. Their response was, \"" sorry, it's Valentines Day and we're short staffed.\"" I informed them that was not my problem, and at the very least someone could at least greet us & inform us that they're running behind. Again, the response was, \""Sorry, we're too busy.\"" At that point we left as the other couple behind us did the same.\n\nA week later, we decided to return for my birthday(after all, we had a free gift certificate to use). If I had trusted my instincts the first time, I would've left the certificate on Valentines Day for someone else to use.\nAfter we again waited 10 minutes before someone aknowledged we were even there, we were seated., We were brought a wine list and asked for our drink order. We stated we would have water while we looked over the wine list. The server brought out tapwater with no ice, and a basket of very dry bread. Again, I started to question myself. (Should I go somewhere else?)\nThe salad was served on a warm plate with very runny dressing. My wife asked for her dressing on the side, and of course her salad was drenched instead.\nFor the main meal, my wife had an undercooked piece of fish, and I had overcooked gnocci.\nThis was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I made sure they were aware of that when I informed them they were not getting a tip. I would stay away from this place. The staff is rude, and they clearly do not care about the customer whatsoever.

2,"Proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  But take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.\n\nThe rolls at Mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  The fish is also not every good quality.  Want to avoid the rice?  You can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  Don't.  It is the worst pieces of fish I've ever had.  Also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  Many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  Probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.\n\nHaving said all that, I really wasn't surprised.  What was I expecting when I was paying so little?  But what really got me down was the service.  The staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  I was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  We figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  We figured wrong.  They brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray.  With some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  We then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  The server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.

2,"I met friends here on the suggestion of Happy Hour eats n drinks. Arriving to the restaurant there were only 2 parking spots open and they were behind the beer truck that was blocking them, next to a foul smelling dumpster and gas tanks sitting out in the open. \nIt was about 4:15pm on a Tuesday. \nI parked and entered and found the ambiance pleasant. I would recommend some blinds for the atrium seating so that during sunset your customers arent in a greenhouse.\n The server was exceptionally polite and helpful and attentive. He even escorted me to the ladies room and advised me they were unisex. He was just a peach! \nThe unisex bathroom however, reeked of urine. There's a reason ladies prefer their own lavatory! \nStructurally speaking, and this is being really picky, when you wash your hands in their unique sink, the faucet sits so low to the basin that your hands come close to dragging in the dirty basin that others have used. Icky. \nOnce the last minutes of happy hour grew near though, our server's attention, understandably, waned. They got slammed. Perhaps a drink runner for that last hour of happy hour would have aided us in getting our drinks BEFORE closing out AND paying our tabs. \nThe food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd, they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections. They fell flat.\n I then ordered the olive medley and a bread loaf which they purportedly bake on site. The olives were plentiful and tasty. The bread however was burnt. It had big empty holes in the middle so the amount of bread was slight. \nOur cocktails were also unique, however some of them fell flat while others were so immensely strong we had to send 1 or 2 back. \nThe reason i will never return to St. Francis isnt even any of the above although it contributes. But the icing, the cherry on top was departing the joint. \nNow I get why these hipster trendspots hire valet companies. The need to \""accommodate\"" the customer who drives, is hopefully met by an attendant who crams your car into a packed lot meant for only about 16 cars. \nWhen I arrived there was no valet to squeeze me into my spot behind the beer truck, next to the dumpster, near the gas tanks. But when I left my car was again blocked in, this time by other cars which had been sandwiched between my rear and the cars in the lanes behind mine. \nit took quite the effort and my passenger getting out to guide me, to get out of my spot safely.\nOn my exit, backwards, through the lot and around a corner, only then did I notice the valets. One was running about, the other seemed  a bit oblivious, flustered. I rolled down my window, and said \""You guys have to be kidding the way you block people in, \"" I said smiling, trying to make light of the situation. \n\""Most people know.\"" he replied.\n\""Know what?\"" I asked.\n\""To let us know.\""\nConfused, I wasnt sure what he meant. \nMy passenger said \""You guys blocked her in and she could barely get out.\""\nThe attendant responded, \""Look lady, that's the name of the game.\""\nMy passenger said \""What game is that?\""\nHe replied sarcastically, \""Well if you've ever been to St. Francis...\""\n\""I have not\"" I cut him off as he continued to try to explain that we should have known to come let them know so they could move cars to let us out. \n1st of all, from my spot I couldnt see that there was even a valet set up.\n2nd of all- to get your attention then to wait for you to rubix cube cars around would have inconvenienced me, YOUR CUSTOMER AND THE PATRON OF THE RESTAURANT THAT HIRES YOUR DUMB ASS TO CAR JOCKEY! \nTo which i replied \""I have not been here before and I wont be back now\"" to which he replied\n\""Well good \"" and rolled his eyes.\nSt Francis- the valet is the first and last impression of your restaurant.

1,"I moved to NW LV 6 months ago and often bike 20+ miles to the strip for some poker and gaming fun. I recently arrived at the Quad to meet a friend passing through town. Upon arriving I had to lock up my bike so I asked valet if they had a bike rack. The attendant replied with uncertainty and told me \""no\"", then said \""maybe in the back\"" and then \""no\"" again. I asked the attendant specifically if there would be a problem if I locked my bike up to a post or railing somewhere. The attendant didn't know or didn't think it would be a problem. I was very sure to show the attendant my concern for locking my bike to an undesignated post but it felt okay to do so according to the response. I proceed through the valet and into the parking garage to first look for a designated bike rack or bike area. After climbing several floors I came across nothing to be designated and proceeded to look for a railing. I came across an old and obviously unused stairway and locked up my bike using a Kryptonite lock and cable to the side of the staircase. I positioned my bicycle in a very thoughtful manner to make sure my handlebars or any extremity were in no way going to block the access of the staircase. I met a friend, we joined a poker tournament and I left roughly 2 hours later. My bike was gone. No evidence of anything was left behind. Immediately it felt like a security issue vs a theft issue. It takes a lot of work to break a Kryptonite U-Lock. I was outraged but I kept my cool and expressed my disgust professionally. \nValet called up security and immediately security became sarcastic and admitted they cut my lock and took my bike because it was illegally locked to a stairway. I then quickly began to explain how I spoke with valet about the bike rack situation and how there was no concern with locking my bike to a post or railing somewhere. Of course they didn't care and had very foolish reasons why they did what they did.  They told me that I should have asked security where to park my bike and not valet, but who would ever think to ask security? Valet seems like the more obvious to me. The security continued to tell me that if I would have asked them, they would have directed me towards the Bell desk and Bell would have taken care of it for me. Who would have thought Bell will take care of your bikes for you? And why aren't the valet trained to tell you that? \n\nI demand an apology and a $25 check to cover the cost of my lock.

5,"I  love this place. This is like a mini version of a Fresh and Easy Market Filipino style. It's a lifesaver if you realize you're out of something like a can of coconut milk or some dried fish or sweet rice flour which is one item I bought today.  Before you drive a half hour or so to Seafood City, come here instead. There is a little of everything you need to make your favorite Filipino dish.  My mom lives 2 miles away, and always sends me or my brother here to get this and that. For North Vegas residents, it's a stress free and rather fun drive.\n\nThis is a family run business, and the service is great.  Unless they're super busy I always ask where the item is that I need.  They'll walk you right over to it, and you can then spend all the time you need to decide which brand to buy.  Of course, I end up asking \""Which of these two are more popular\""  And they give their honest opinion.\n\nI like that in season, they have some fresh produce. They have some freshly roasted peanuts which were $1.90 a pound.  We actually boil them for a nice snack. Almost always they have cooking bananas, sometimes they have papayas, fresh coconut, oranges, melons, etc. My mom often sends us here to get various noodles for pancit, along with lumpia, perhaps the most popular Filipino dishes. The dish that most of our friends love the most is dinuguan, roughly translated, \""made from  pork blood\"".  When you add coconut milk lean pork, vinegar, salt, and sometimes innards like intestines, spices like bay leaf and black pepper, garlic, onion, etc...the flavor is quite unique, mild slightly sweet. My doc says this is a great dish if you have iron poor blood. \n\nAt the front counter are desserts made by Valerio's bakery. I find myself always buying something sweet.  This trip for $10 I bought a taro and sweet rice tootsie roll shaped dessert coated with coconut called Puto Bong Bong.  They also had a multi layer, multi colored sweet rice cake called Sapin Sapin.

2,"First of all, like everyone else, I've wanted to try this place. I've heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. \n\nI arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), \""We don't seat parties if they aren't all here, but you can check if they're in there.\"" Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. \n\nFirst of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer's platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there's a difference between good and thinking something's good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. \n\nSecond, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I've had better service when Binion's Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. \n\nThird, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you're practically sitting on their neighbor's lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don't get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. \n\nFourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she \""LOST\"" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would've picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I'm not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn't be that rude to anyone! \n\nI give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it's worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We'll see...\n\nSo Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to  pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn't  running around forgetting people's orders, losing people's credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer's platters can pay a waiter's 4 hour shift and they'd provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!",427128,"Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=ChoiceLogprobs(content=[ChatCompletionTokenLogprob(token='2', bytes=[50], logprob=-0.00015872349, top_logprobs=[TopLogprob(token='2', bytes=[50], logprob=-0.00015872349), TopLogprob(token=' two', bytes=[32, 116, 119, 111], logprob=-11.000158), TopLogprob(token='ï¼’', bytes=[239, 188, 146], logprob=-11.062658), TopLogprob(token='two', bytes=[116, 119, 111], logprob=-11.375158)])], refusal=None), message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='2', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))",2,-0.00015872349

1,I went for a nice meal tonight and wound up with a rather bad experience. I first sat in the bar and got a drink. After watching the bartender cater to a group of five while I sat alone and waited 10 minutes for a menu I decided to sit somewhere else in the main dining room.  Kevin then served me. Everything was fine until a party of eight showed up and then he could care less about me and did not show up but once every 20 minutes. Of course when he did come by he wanted to know if I wanted another $20 glass of wine to pump up the bill.

I had to talk to a salesgirl and two managers, one who had to call a higher up. For $40. come on people. I think I fought with them for a half an hour.

2,"Thai me up and take me to a different Thai Restaurant. The price and the decor are the only things going for Galanga. \n\nThe RJ Food section gave them a cover story review and romanticized about the DIY Thai Iced Tea so since I am junkie for Thai Tea I had to experience this. The presentation was original with the tea iced cubes, but when I individually smelled one of the ingredients it smelled like nail polish remover. Ugh. Maybe my smeller was off so I continued making my tea combining all of the ingredients and it was a fail. I didn't enjoy it and spent most of my meal trying to make the damn tea taste better. FAIL. \n\nNow for the food, the only thing going for it is the price. My lunch was $4.95 and came with soup or rice porridge which fell flat in the flavor department. Both my friend and I tried to dress it up with Sriracha, but decided it still didn't work for us. Second out of the kitchen was the Papaya Salad for $7.95. This tasted different than others around the valley which was due to the lime vinaigrette. It was bitter and missing something sweet or spicy to balance it out. Sad because minus the dressing this may have been a winner. Last to arrive was my Panang Curry Chicken. The portion was to my liking and the chicken appeared to be all white meat which usually makes me happy, but with one bite I knew I would never be back. It wasn't so bad that I spit it out, but it was just boring. Nothing should be boring about Curry especially when you order it at the highest heat level. The sauce lacked thickness and spice. It was at a toddler heat level which just pissed me off. This white girl likes it spicy! \n\nThe conclusion to this story is just because a restaurant looks good and the RJ raves about it doesn't mean shit.

4,"I don't gamble, and if I do it's like $100. I'm the type of Asian guest that the Palazzo doesn't want, and they do cater to Asians since over 80% of the whales and hi-rollers are Asian. That's why you'll be properly accommodated if you want to watch Korean, Chinese, and Japanese TV shows (I hope they have Viet channels cuz Viets sure do throw down big money in Vegas).\n\nI only have some small issues with the Palazzo because after all, it's supposed to be a 5-star hotel?\n\nPROS:\n- Overall big spacious rooms (everybody's reviews below spells out the specifics).\n\nCONS:\n- The design of the Palazzo is very middle-of-the road, and it doesn't take the themed gimmick route like the Venetian, New York New York, Paris, Excalibur, etc. Instead, they've designed a fairly lackluster interior that's very forgettable. Even the lobby seems indistinctly tucked away into one side of the main rotunda which can be overlooked if you're not paying attention.\n- The management was gracious enough to let us check-in early since we got in prior to 3pm, but I don't know if room service would have put the finishing touch on everything, but I noticed a bunch of annoying details:\n  1. the lamp fixture in the bathroom was tilted, and it needed to be straightened out.\n  2. Small gripe, but when someobody's in the bathroom frantically spinning the toilet paper roll, you can hear it while your laying in the bed. This could take a toll on having \""sweet dreams\"".... I imagine dreams of trying to balance yourself atop a log while cruising down a river of chocolate... yea chocolate.\n  3. Design wise, the door knob they decided to use on the doors is deceiving because I had a friend say \""there's somebody in the bathroom\"" because they couldn't turn the handle thinking it was locked. Instead, you just have to pull on the door - either you're a moron, or it's intuitively ingrained in us to turn a handle. \n  4. Like the Se Hotel in San Diego, there's a gap in the bathroom door which is a huge perverted plus because they also don't have a lock on the doors. So if you have female guests, they'll have to barricade the doors if they can't trust you. My friend didn't shower.\n  5. It would have been nice to use the refrigerator in the room, but any sort of movement in the mini-bar would have resulted in additional room charges. Not to mention, the ice bucket they provide you is extremely tiny. \n  6. The bell check didn't bother helping us with any of our luggage when we drove up!?! They only assisted the people getting out of the taxi cabs. What's up with that? I know they don't offer valet, but isn't this the simplest thing they could do because it set the tone for the remainder of our stay.\n  7. Out of the 3 bathrooms, the bathroom TV wouldn't turn off, and it also didn't have the same channels as the other two?! So we couldn't find the shows we were watching on the other two.\n\nOverall it was a decent stay on NYE at the Palazzo because the rooms are so spacious which is great for hosting a bunch of your friends prior to going out. I bet Chinese New Year would be even better in Vegas.

The Deuce stops right outside the casino near the buffet and runs from Fremont Street to the Mandalay, with enough stops in between to get you where you want to go.  As for the surrounding area, you can actually walk outside and get a decent price on some food, or a bottle of liquor, for those looking to enjoy Vegas on a budget.  The rides were okay, the Big Shot being the only must do, but the views are awesome and the place is nowhere near as crowded as most of the strip casinos.  I highly recommend the strat, particularly the upgraded Select rooms.  My only negative applies to all of Vegas, as I am a non-smoker.  Nothing is more ridiculous than watching 50 people walk through a casino get irritated as they walk by one idiot chain smoking at a slot machine.

I'm one of those people who has positive things to say about just about anywhere...but not here.  Don't get me wrong--I have no problem with this individual location.  I have been trying to order something site-to-store from the parent company website for three days.  First, they advertised it as one price but as soon as it went into my cart it showed up as costing $100 more!  Because of our timeline, I ordered the item.  Well, Guitar Center must have a HUGE amount of fraud, because my credit card was instantly shut down (and I buy a lot of weird stuff, a lot of stuff online, spend money in different countries all the time, etc--this was NOT an expensive item, either)..  WOW!  So once I get that cleared up, I sent a screen shot of the original price--a price that I had confirmed via telephone with GC CS rep Preston.  They \""lost\"" my first screen shot.  I re-sent it, and uploaded it to a server to provide them with a URL...so this time they couldn't lose it.  All the while, EVERY agent asked me to call them on the phone to re-order.  I went through a friend's affiliate link after they told me about GC, giving them appropriate credit for the sale--so this unscrupulous company was actually trying to get out of giving credit under the terms of their OWN affiliate program!  So now they're claiming they have to cancel my order and I have to re-order via the phone, or they cannot honor their own coupon code.\n\nWell, the STORE might be just fine.  I don't know.  I didn't make it that far.  But I can tell you that the parent operation is questionable.  I'd rather give my business to a more ethical operation.

However no dance floor the man walk way has DJ setup and is the dance floor with DJ setup off to the side so everyone dancing is in the way of servers trying to get drinks out to the balcony and bottle service areas and even employees that need to bring supplies to the bar have to go through the dance floor causing spilled drinks etc (Moon had a large traditional dedicated dance floor which was great) . DJ was erratic gong from hip hop the EDM to old school to God knows what. Whatever type of music you like there's a song you like you go to the dance floor (walkway where people are dancing) then next track will be something totally different and kill the vibe (Moon had more consistent DJs). Balcony is tiny (compared to Moon which has an awesome balcony). Drinks were pricey $16 for bottom shelf well drinks. Very little seating other than bottle service areas. Like alot of the clubs in the last several years this club only makes sense to me if you a planning to go VIP and get bottle service and socialize.

While the room wasn't anything special, it was decent. The whole room was huge, there were mirrors over the bed (classy!), and it had the craziest shower/bath I had ever scene! The whole thing was surrounded by mirrors and glass. When it got fogged over it was a bit like something out of some scary movie however. Oh, and you have to be 5ft tall or shorter if you want to take a shower. Unless you don't mind knelling in the tub. But, they kept the room clean and it was in a great location.\n\nRoom service was decent. However, I wouldn't waste money eating anywhere else in the hotel. Not a good food selection. The casino is well equipped with a variety of slot machines, which is nice for the slot machine junkies (like myself). The car show is worth seeing and pretty reasonably priced. Definitely something I would do again.\n\nI wouldn't recommend staying in the expansion on the back.

I went in looking for a 1-bedroom apartment. \n\nI am on the hunt for an apartment and I took myself through north scottsdale today, stopping in at paragon on my tour. I would say that just about every apartment sales office that opens on sundays (some don't, granted) opens at 12PM and stays open to 4 or 5PM. I arrived at 12:45 to find out that Paragon doesn't open until 1PM. lame. I toyed with leaving and not seeing the property, but didn't listen to my instincts (mistake #1). I waited it out and came back at about 1:05. \n\nI walk inside and there is no one at reception, well fine, i'll just wait. Someone yells from the back \""Morning!!\"" I don't know if they are talking to me so I say nothing. \""MORNING!!!\"" again. \""oh hi there\"" I reply. \""You are just going to have to wait, I'm setting up still!\"" Huh? Who says that? I wasn't complaining about waiting, and besides that, you don't talk to clients or prospective clients that way. \n\nIris walks out and offers me a cookie as she walks by saying \""you know we don't open until 1PM\"" me: \""It is one, isn't it?\"" her: \""barely.\"" UGH! Why didn't I leave?! Then we are talking and she's getting my info and she asks my price range and then tells me \""oh well you won't find that here.\"" and yet I didn't leave (mistake #56 at this point). So for the first half of the tour and explanation she is a big puffed up elitist telling me how exclusive this is or how fancy and amazing that is.

3,"I have very mixed views on Bartolotta... \n\nI don't like the restaurant itself, like most things Wynn touches, it's overdone and gaudy...lacking any semblance of taste, simplicity, tact and sophistication. \n\nI'm also not a fan of the overcomplicated corkage fee process...Not allowing wines on their wine list, and  basically hiking the price and try to make you think you're getting your money's worth because they chill your wine to your liking, etc. \n\nThe wine list is a joke... and displays a real audacity. It takes balls to charge $10 for a glass of $7 \""sparkling\"" wine(Zardetto Veneto)! Or $15 for a glass of house wine that's worth $18 a bottle(Abbazia di Novacello)...Their \""better\"" selections aren't really all that much better, $42 for a glass of $70 wine(Brigaldara Amarone della Valpolicella Classico DOCG)... But as usual, they get away with it because the majority of people are not familiar with wines. I'm not singling Bartolotta out on this, almost all restaurants and even wine bars, do it.\n\n I also think the whole gimmick of having people buy an entire fish is ridiculous. You're looking at $200 or more for a fish that was caught in some of Europe's dirtiest waters.... although they've made a lot of strides over the last decade...  \n\nAnd...I also wouldn't recommend the tasting menu, here or anywhere else...namely for the fact that when I go out to eat, I want a meal...and a tasting menu is... Well, it is exactly what it says it is....and it's not very pragmatic.\n\nSo why three stars you might ask? \n\nThe pasta dishes are really good...you can request an entree size portion at double the appetizer price. It's pricy, but given the quality of the ingredients, authenticity of the preparation, and the fact that you won't find these dishes at many other places...if at any, it town, I'd say it's worth it.  With appetizers, entrees and corkage fee, two people can have an excellent, fine dining(at least as far as the food is concerned) experience for around $150. Which isn't bad considering...\n\nThe insalata di piovra Ligure always consists of tender squid and the wine-vinegar-olive oil ratio is perfect... and the rabbit loin with artichoke hearts and balsamic vinegar is addictive.\n\nThe  lasagnette con ragu di crostacei and the spaghetti all'astice both use quality seafood...the flavors and textures are perfectly balanced.\n\nThe  maccheroni with the rag\u00f9 Toscano and the agnolotti al plin are also good choices. The Tuscan ragu is rich and flavorful...quality ingredients are used. While the agnolotti meat filling is perfectly flavored.

Cue spa day! \n\nI scheduled a 50 minute Ashiatsu massage because I can't seem to find anyone who does them in Atlanta and, if you really like deep tissue massage, there is truly nothing like it. The therapist massages you with his or her FEET! And no, they're not just walking on your back like my parents had me do when I was a kid, they are truly *massaging* you with those footsies, while holding on to bars bolted into the ceiling.

The red patent leather doors, the black and white pictures on the walls, the waitresses' outfits, the interior of the restaurant, and best of all, the window. As someone who has no interest in nudity but loves to watch sexy girls dance, I really liked that every half hour or so, a very attractive girl would appear behind appear in a small room behind a large glass window.

The maitake with truffle butter was absolutely delicious (about 5 mushrooms), the steak was just ok. The bok choy was very VERY good. The portions were miniscule. The fingerlng potatoes were literally TWO potatoes, halved. For desert we had a flavored creme brulee, or at least they called it creme brulee.

At $11.75 I expected better.\n\nAccording to the menu it's served with bread, butter, and salad. The lasagna itself was uneventful and dry with no where near enough sauce. Basically it appeared as unseasoned plain browned hamburger meat and some cheese wrapped like a burrito with the pasta, sauce, some more cheese, and baked in a foil bowl no where near long enough to even heat it thoroughly and melt the cheeses. \n\nThe bread appeared to be a sub roll, not toasted garlic bread like most Italian restaurants would serve. And they forgot the butter, which definitely would have helped get that dry bread down!\n\nThe salad consisted of a small container of prepackaged lettuce, shreaded cheese and black olives. And not the freshest I've encountered. And don't expect home made ranch dressing, again, prepackaged. Maybe I'll try another pasta dish in the future to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the spaghetti is better. \n\nSo this week I decided to try the hot wings. How hard can it be to screw up buffalo wings? Apparently it's pretty easy! The wing sauce was served on the side, which I liked, but whomever was manning the fryer left them in WAY too long and burnt them to a crisp! YUCK! I guess burnt chicken is better than raw chicken. And again, prepackaged ranch dressing. (Hint hint - Hidden Valley Ranch mix is available in a restaurant size. Just add butter milk and mayo and you're good to go!)\n\nI really wish these folks would get their quality control issues addressed.

But certain changes recently are bumping down my rating.\n\nThe good\nMost of the food is delicious. My favorite is the vegetable tempura soup. Their happy hour is extremely affordable. Very cheap sake bombers. My husband likes the sushi rolls on happy hour. I'm not a fan of the vegetarian choices for happy hour. The sweet potato fries aren't very good. They don't have any veggie rolls on special for happy hour (c'mon veggies are cheaper than fish!) so I end up ordering my favorite roll, the veggie tempura roll, off the menu. It is always super tasty. The servers are sooo nice. They can be a little slow and forgetful when the restaurant is busy but they are too nice and genuine to get mad at them.\n\nThe bad\nAs I mentioned I usually order the veggie tempura roll for happy hour, even though it is not happy hour priced. Well, one roll isn't enough for me to get filled up so up to 2 months ago, I would order a side of PLAIN fried rice. Their fried rice is yummy. It was only about a cup full but it was perfect accompaniment to one veggie roll. Last time we went in for happy hour I tried ordering my usual veggie roll and SIDE of fried rice. The server looked at me with guilty eyes and said \""Oh, we can't do that anymore.\"" He said if I wanted to order fried rice I would have to order the $8 fried rice entree. The fried rice entree has an option of chicken or beef, which is probably why it is a whopping 8 bucks. I'm a vegetarian who just wants some damn fried rice without any meat but I am not going to pay $8 for just rice. The server said the manager put an end to the restaurant offering it as a side. Talk about nickel and diming! How cheap can you get? It's RICE!

2,I'm not saying this to be mean but what my inexperienced waitress did to me was comical and not excusable. I DO NOTE I am NOT basing my review on what she did and only the food but I feel it needs to be told so you see the whole picture.\n\nShe took our order and soon came to deliver the drinks . Her tray had three beverages a water an iced tea and a soda. Somehow she sorts of looses her balance and almost lost the water and it spills ON ME with Iced cubes hitting me but she manages to save it before it all splashes me. She said she was sorry but she suggested to ME TO CLEAN THE TABLE WITH THE PAPER TOWEL MYSELF! It's bad enough that she couldn't be bothered to clean that up but what really made it WORST was she left the wet napkin on the table the whole time we were dining. I do note she was very youthful and might have been only 15 or 16 years old so I have to chalk it up to that but I also note the cooks on the night I was here were also very youthful looking and I might not have experienced the food as it was meant to be prepared.\n\nWe started out with very average house salads and fried pickles appetizer. The salads seemed fresh and the dressing seemed bottled tasting and not so good. I thought the pickle appetizer was inedible not because of them being wet laden with oil but because of how overly salted they were. My husband who tolerates more salt than me didn't think inedible but he felt too that they were over salted and he ate only a few.\n\nOur two plates arrive and my husband got nearly everything they make on his plate and asked me to try stuff I didn't have. I only tried his short rib and had to stop there because it was DRY and almost cold. (YUK!) so then I moved on to my plate. I tried the BBQ'd Turkey first. It was almost good with good flavors and not too much sauce. I also liked that the sauce wasn't too sweet but like the Rib it was dry and almost cold. (YUK! again) So I figure maybe the chicken is good but I was WRONG again. (YUK!) Another almost COLD and VERY DRY. I really hate dry chicken. I had a nice looking side of vegetables but sadly they were ruined by a generous hand of BUDGET SEASONING SALT that tasted awful. Lastly I was hoping the corn bread would be ok but I WAS WRONG AGAIN and SADLY it was so dry and so from the box tasting even soaking it in honey butter couldn't fix it.\n\nI do note my husband said the store purchased hot link wasn't as dry as the BBQ'd other items. He also said the pork ribs were better than the beef rib. I also need to say  I hope that the day time crew prepares the food in the way the owner meant it to be. I say that because of the numerous BBQ awards they've earned that I saw here while dining.

The menu is big and has many variety kind of food from noodles, rice, steak, curries and salad depends on what mood you're in. Pictures on the menu is a big help to kinda give you the ideas of what the food will look like. They did a really good job on that.\n\nService is nice. In fact I got all the servers waiting on me.  Place is very clean and modern. The staffs were friendly and attentive. For a quick lunch it's nice to be able to grab 2-3 items food from what they called a la carte which is prepared food similar to Panda Express. The price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would recommend anyone who want to try their a la carte to get in before 1.30pm for fresh food. Otherwise if you get there later than that it seems like the food is old and had been sitting there for a while.\n\nI have no complain about the food here. Food is always good and full of flavor. They have the best Pad Thai ever! Must try! I tried to order something different everytime I go there. So far so good.\n\nI got a kick out of reading the review below that give Thai Cafe 1 star. Seems like this is their first time having Thai food and they have no idea what to order. I went there on Friday and saw the happy hour stand on the table that says $1 off appetizer/salad between 5-something and during the football game. Also the Thai beer was only $3. \n\nI've never heard of chicken in papaya salad before. If I'm wrong please let me know but I think you're mistaken it for something else? Papaya salad is very refreshing by the way.\n\nGinger salad is supposed to be grounded meat wasn't it? There was a picture on the menu I believe. I ordered mine with chicken. It had a very good flavor but too much ginger for me.\n\nOverall I have good experiences so far with this restaurant. It's our favorite Thai restaurant!

3,"If you're headed there for  the lunch hour, you probably should put your \""out of office\"" on your email because you'll be there for at least the next two hours. \n\nAlas, when I saw that there was a lunch special (about $10 for a half salad and pizza), I figured it would be a relatively typical lunch hour. Usually places that have lunch specials abide by the 1-hour lunch rule, but definitely not this place--at least, not in this instance. Holy moly, I had no idea that it took so long to make salad and pizza at Humble Pie. I am a regular at Sauce Pizza + Wine, and it usually takes them about 3 minutes to bring my salad after ordering, then another 5 minutes to have my pizza out. I think we were about 45 minutes into being at Humble Pie when our salads were brought out. I think my coworker was about ready to eat his shirt at that point.\n\nAlright, so how good was this hyped up place? Well...it was ok. First, I was a little surprised that the restaurant was small and the tables were kind of cramped, but I guess that adds to the ambiance of being a humble place. I ordered the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was OK, but not very flavorful. It kind of tasted like a salad I'd make at home. My pizza was a standard pepperoni, to which I added on olives. The pepperoni is the smaller diameter style pepperoni found at some other specialty pizza joints like Grimaldi's. It was uber salty and greasy, which felt very sinful as I was eating it. I think there was enough pepperoni on the pizza to cover 2 or 3 pizzas, actually. The crust, cheese and sauce were good, however. I suppose I should have ordered a veggie pizza or something a little less meaty to enjoy my meal.\n\nOverall, the food was OK, but nothing out of the ordinary special that I'd die to take my friends to.

(Thankfully, since I wouldn't have made it to see feb 15th if he cooked for us,lol).\n\nTo start, it may seem like a long wait but I was really impressed we only had to wait an hour and twenty minutes to get out food delivered. We're a good 4.5 miles away and I'm sure they were really busy, so points to them for that, and points for a really friendly delivery man! \n\nFood wise, it did arrive cold which wasn't great because one of the dishes was chicken Parm and the cheese was no longer bubbly and soft. As much as I have to take a point off for this, I really don't hold it against them. Since it was valentines day, I do imagine it must have sat  there ready for a bit before someone was actually able to get it out to us. I'm ok with it for that reason. We popped it in the oven and for the most part brought it back to life. \n\nOnce it was ready despite the fact that my chicken Parm wasn't up to it's potential, the food was pretty tasty, especially their sauce which had a mild kick and a nice bold flavor. In Italian cooking, the sauce can really make or break the dish, and their's definitely elevated these dishes. I honestly wish their was more,  but that's my only complaint there.\n\nOverall, I feel that Giada's has potential to be 5 stars in my book, but I'll have to reserve that until next time I order.

4,"I was just visiting Pittsburgh and I never been to the city before so I came here because everyone said that Primanti Brothers is a rite of passage.  So I went.\n\nHISTORY:  The original one is located in the Pittsburgh Strip District, a really busy area along with the Allegheny River which are dotted with warehouses and produce yards.  The owner, Joe Primanti, invented his famous sandwich during the Great Depression.  This spawned all kinds of sandwiches and the restaurant became a stop for late-night and early-morning workers.  For decades, it was a big food stop for truck drivers. Because they usually had to get their burgers or sandwiches to go, the restaurant started putting the fries inside the burgers and sandwiches so they can eat their entire meal with ease while driving. That eventually became their signature piece for all their sandwiches. Even though it's an eatery for all and is a foodery stop for everyone crazy about the Burgh, the original Primantis still keeps it's super large parking lot for truck drivers to make their routine stop for food. Pittsburgh is a working class city who loves (LOVES) their sports so Primanti Brothers is an insanely popular place to pre or post-game or to game-game while eating and drinking. It's now a chain that is all throughout the east coast but in Pittsburgh it's a staple.  Whenever TV stations (notably ESPN) do an expose on the city, Primanti Brothers is always mentioned, visited and spotlighted.\n\nFOOD: Heavy. They put their fries inside their burger. Um, I guess that's a novelty but conceptually it's like a turducken. Kind of too much.  But excess is the theme of all their signature burgers and sandwiches or you can custom-make your excess.  Add more fries, sauces, an egg, double up on meat, combine different kinds of meat.  Mention the word diet and everyone will look at you as if you're from California, which in this case, is true. But the restaurant, per their menu, states that their sandwiches are only the number 2 favorite.  The title of number one favorite goes to beer.  Not a particular kind.  Just beer in general.  Smile.\n\nSERVICE: Incredibly friendly and they love the question \""What's your favorite?\"" to which the answer will, again, be beer.  Another smile.  Tell them you're new and just visiting Pittsburgh, they'll relish the opportunity to fill you in on not just the favorites of the menu but their personal favorites in the city at large.\n\nCONSENSUS:  Definitely not a place to eat if you're dieting, paleo or vegan unless it's a cheat day or you relapse into the world of meat.  But if you can appreciate the hearty sports bar fanfare, you'll find yourself at home here with your stomachs full.  The restaurant, itself, is very welcoming and the bar area is incredibly social, especially if there is a game playing.  As a visiter of the city as a whole, I don't know if this is characteristic to the restaurant or the city as a whole, but, regardless, I will swing by again when I have business in Pittsburg in the future.

3,"Oh, fuku burger. What a colorful and moody character you seem to be.\n\nAfter a night of shenanigans, the boy wanted a treat. Having spotted the illusive Fuku-truck on our way elsewhere, we hoped they'd still be there when we were done. Around 2 AM, they were, and had a big crowd of costumed fans gathering around. Descending upon the Bank of America parking lot, you can hear their music blasting; we arrived to a song about capping people and a chorus of gun-shots and the N-word. Kind of awkward, but whatever. It seems there's a lot of repeat customers or fans that hang around the truck, as there were people parked and hanging out by or in their cars for the entire duration we were there. \n\nThere was no sense of organization in the line, just a clusterf**k of people mobbing around the lone girl taking orders. We had several people attempt to get in front of us and others asking us where the line ended. Some people stood on the periphery of the cluster and waited for 10+ minutes in the cold in skimpy costumes before getting frustrated and leaving without anything.\n\nThe music was also so loud that it made ordering a challenge unless you got in the poor girl's face or yelled at her. She took our name and put our order in. When done a guy would scream out your name  from the window, vainly competing with the music. We watched him call for 4-5 people with visibly growing aggrivation. \n\nThe menu itself was pretty simple, though I know you can customize with eggs or extra patties. We opted for the Karai, or spicy burger, and an order of their garlic fries. We ate the fries on the drive home and had the burger once there. The fries seemed like they were from a box then heavily dosed with their garlic salt. I liked the sauces that came with them, but J thought they were too salty. The fries had decent crunch and heft- they weren't potato needles or massive steak fries.\n\nOnce we got to the burger, we were disappointed. The burger had flavor but was burnt on the outside and ultra-rare on the inside. Topped with a spicy mayo, another sauce, cucumber, avocado \""cream\"" and a couple of other toppings, it had an interesting combo of textures and flavors to compliment the meatiness, but not enough to save it from being mediocre. The burger may have been more redeemable if the experience/atmosphere of ordering it hadn't put us off. \n\nThe area around the truck was trashed with half eaten food and debris everywhere. Stickers and photos covered much of the windows and the only insights we had into the kitchen was the irritated guy sticking his head out and yelling at a \""mutha fuga'!\""to get back in the truck. \n\nThis is really an instance where the business philosophy shines at the forefront. Compare these fellows to the Slider truck; The boys there sing while cooking, happily greet their customers with enthusiasm & a fist bump, maintain a clean exterior and fairly consistent food preparation. I've had a mediocre slider and forgiven them because they were so pleasant to deal with.
