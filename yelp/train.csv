5,"Best Pedicure in Las Vegas, hands down ( no pun intended). So I very apprehensively  tried this place a few weeks ago. I have extremely high standards in regards to cleanliness, attention to detail. My technician was Bamboo. Bamboo should get an award for turning my hooves into beautiful, smooth, pretty feet. I should probable go the DMV and change my reported height. I would imagine I'm about a 1/4 shorter after my callus removal :-) I love them, and I'm sure you will too!",266226
5,"This place is legit!!! My first time after hearing about it from friends.  I am definitely returning and OFTEN.  The flavor was intense for me and authentic.  I split some food with friends and had half of the pastrami sandwich and a slice of pizza which was very yummy! Of course, I couldn't leave without trying their spumoni which topped it all...bits of chocolate and pistachios mixed within the flavors. Prices were very reasonable. Wanting my next date night there :)",259076
2,"Only scoring a two star because the food was edible and the vibe of the place was very cool. After spending a lot of dough on an amazing meal at STK the night before we decided on a more casual less expensive (or so we thought!) one. Todd English has gotten a lot of buzz on Top Chef so why not? Well this is why not: the food was ridiculously overpriced, carelessly made and couldn't hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost. My $20 plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back, when it came back the flavor wasn't even up to Costco's high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce. I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was $87 before the tip!! $20 for one beer flight of four tiny tastes? Really? The only thing I enjoyed about my meal was the French onion soup but beware for $9 it'll be half the size of the one you are used to. This place is a miss for me. Not coming back unless Todd invites me to dine for free.",445505
3,"Located next to Amos' Southend, this bar is a nice little retreat if you're looking to get out of Amos' for a bit.\n\nI was at Amos' for a concert one night & was tired of the opening act. So my friend & I headed over to the Gin Mill to check the scores of the game before the main act came on stage. From the moment we walked in, you could tell this place was a sports bar. This probably had to due with the fact that they are a Notre Dame friendly bar, & the Irish were playing, but it still was a very lively atmosphere. With plenty of tvs throughout the place, there wasn't a bad seat in the house to catch the game. I'm not sure if it's always as crazy when the Irish aren't playing, but it was great when they were.\n\nWhile it was a short trip to the Gin Mill, I think it's a great little bar to check out if you're at Amos' and tired of that scene. You can pop into the Gin Mill pretty quickly & grab a drink. And if the Irish are playing, look out.",80466
4,"Great dinner:\n\n- beef carpaccio outstanding. (2-4 people could share this.)\n- lobster bolognese inventive & outstanding.\n- zucchini flower/crema flatbread good, not great. (breading on flowers too heavy)\n- staff very friendly and laid back (unlike some other places that can be stiff).\n- breads and tapenades very nice.\n- ask to sit by window (or on terrace if not too hot) to enjoy fountains. Pretty cool to dine by 250 ft wall of water!\n- one drawback: seating is very cramped, and it's really loud. Reminds me of NYC restaurants, but in LV a bit more space is expected.",174045
4,"Unlike my boyfriend Darren W, I'm not much of a burger fanatic, so when we came here last night, I tried their bbq chicken, and thought it was very good. Very moist and sweet. Also, as a side, I had the broccoli which was perfectly steamed. The service was awesome, and the place has an old-time charm to it. It worked for me. They have no desserts, but I guess that's what Oh! Yogurt's for. :)",3537
2,"Tried the Scottsdale location with a co-worker of mine..... Food was AVERAGE at best.  Had the shrimp po-boy and he had black and blue burger.  His burger came out well done.  YUCK.  When he brought it up to server, she said all of our burgers are prepared medium well.  Would have been great if she stated that or asked when he ordered.  In all fairness she did offer to re order it.  We had to get going so he declined.  Dont think I will go back, too many options in this part of town with far superior food.",371978
1,"Dear Larry this is david ristick we had my sons 16th birthday day party I love your restaurant your food your service is always five stars !!! we love your whole family we've been friends for years I was there since you open the restaurant Your new GM Maurice made us feel so unwelcome so miserable that it made me feel like I would never want to come there again you know that I drove all away from LA to make my son's birthday party special and  he made us feel so bad that I never want to come back there again if he is working He should be fired!! With all due respect to you your family and your establishment God bless you Larry keep keeping the food coming out good just get rid of this guy ASAP he will ruin your restaurant! He actually said when I told him that I drove from LA  and that I drove 400 miles And he said i \""quote I don't care if you drove 4000 miles! \""What a loser!",91180
1,"I have been several times and nope it sucks. Back to Panda. The meat taste strange, I mean real strange. The Mongolian no matter how much Soy Sauce a molecule can take its still bland. At least at YC's or even Genghis Grill you have options. You will find that there are several dishes that are decent and its all chicken...I hope...",32336

5,"I have been coming to this practice for years. It is a true family practice, however, they are progressive and they do everything in-house, they have their own x-rays, labs, chiropractor and physical therapy. I have used almost all of their services without any complaints. They are thorough and take the time to discuss all your needs. I personal use Dr. Becky, the PA, but I have also seen Bruce.",26756

3,"Driving down the freeway I saw a billboard that said something like: \n19 times in a row voted best steak.. \n\nThis caught my eye real fast, so the following weekend I had dinner here.\nLocated in the Circus Circus Hotel & Casino, Its entrance looked quite elegant for its surroundings.. Walking in, there's a room that exposed raw cattle hanging from the ceiling ready to be charbrioled and served. I thought that was interesting. We got seated promptly and our waiter was very polite. \n\nI ordered the Ribeye steak with a side of  mashed potato (my usual combination). The bread was decent and house salad was good. The steak came shortly afterwards and had that charbroiled aroma to it. It was a hefty piece and had the right amount of char. The steak was pretty tender, juicy and had an all natural steak flavor. Overall it  was better than average but  not spectacular. The mashed potatoes were mediocre. The wine did help with the whole experience..\n\nOldschool Steakhouse that still Holds its own..",135859
4,"I have no idea what this place is like at night, or during the weekday lunch rush, but for lunch on a Saturday...it's perfect.  Not very busy, so its easy to get a spot at the small bar, or about any table you would want.  I prefer to sit at the bar during the day.  It's also the best way to get to know a new spot.\n\nTacos are great, but the pernil asada tacos are excellent.  Chips and salsa are fresh and the salsa has a nice kick.\n\nHighly reccomend the jalepeno infused margarita.  Amazing how many truly awful margaritas are available in the valley, but they do them very well here.\n\nPrices are more than reasonable and the happy hour prices are great.\n\nHopefully this place can be the start of bringing back The Esplanade.",485401
1,They should have a rating of zero stars.  I play 20 bucks to wait an hour for at best a half clean car.  Stay away!!! Danny must not get his car cleaned here.,400690
1,"Was in here today to purchase 3 things. I had a coupon for 1.00 off of Purex Cystals and I had used one the other day with no problem. I got to the cashier and the coupon would not scan, so she proceeds to read the whole thing word for word then tells me I got the wrong size. There is no size on the coupon, like I said I used the same one a few days ago.  She calls over her manager who tells me if the computer does not recognize it they do not take it. I said \""Seriously\"" and her manager turns around to me and says \""Yeah Seriously\"" ..No I am sorry . nothing . She did override and took the dollar off and when I said Thank You she just walked away. It's not about the dollar it's about the customer service and how rude this manager was .",407091
1,"Worst club/ lounge on the strip! Don't go!!! Bartenders suck! They r too busy trying to get ass instead of trying to make ur drink! Security is a joke... The only exception is Marcus!! 2 fights, my wife got drink thrown on her and we just walked thru the door!! Don't go unless ur desperate  and nobody care, management don't give 2 fucks!! My wife got harrassed by security instead of the Muthafuckas fighting! Daniel, the management of security cares more about getting a $20 tip than taking care of his customers! I come to Vegas, quite often, never again will I ever come to Koi!! Please avoid it if u can!!!",615186
4,"Tried this place twice. Once for take out and once dine in. Both times we got the soft shell crab. Me likes! With all the fried garlic to pick at, Yum! It's a little on the $$ end, but hey, it's soft shell crab. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but for what we can get around here, I was satisfied. \n\nI'll just mention the things we got during the dine in since it was more recent and I remember it better... ;)\n\nThe cold appetizers - tofu, white - not spicy, greenish (not sure if that was tofu, but hey, I don't really mind. If it tastes good I'll try it!)  - little spicy, pig ear - spicy. All were delish!\n\nThere's a hot oil & spicy fish dish. They're known for it. That was super good! We did ask for it not to be as spicy and they accommodated us, which was nice. It was just enough kick for us. TRY THAT! She also recommended the equivalent dish, but with lamb. Next time I'd like to taste test that one. \n\nThe fried pork ribs were just normal. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. We also got a veggie dish. We always ask what kind of veggies they have. Sometimes they have ones that aren't on the menu. \n\nAll this filled the 6 of us and was pretty reasonable in price. \n\nI liked the service. I mean really, I never go to a Chinese restaurant expecting good service. I just look forward to the food. But the lady gave us her recommendations. We were hesitant on the fish dish (bc we weren't sure if it'd be too spicy), and she told us to get the lunch portion vs the dinner since it was smaller and if we didn't like it, we wouldn't have as much. That was cool. \n\nIf you like spicy, I'm sure this place would fill your tank. If you aren't total spicy fans, there's still enough stuff and ways for them to accommodate to your liking, like they did for us.",530716
4,"Due to the fact that I didn't feel like spending a ton of money and going to a packed restaurant on Valentines Day, my husband planned a romantic night in and decided to order from Giada's for the first time. (Thankfully, since I wouldn't have made it to see feb 15th if he cooked for us,lol).\n\nTo start, it may seem like a long wait but I was really impressed we only had to wait an hour and twenty minutes to get out food delivered. We're a good 4.5 miles away and I'm sure they were really busy, so points to them for that, and points for a really friendly delivery man! \n\nFood wise, it did arrive cold which wasn't great because one of the dishes was chicken Parm and the cheese was no longer bubbly and soft. As much as I have to take a point off for this, I really don't hold it against them. Since it was valentines day, I do imagine it must have sat  there ready for a bit before someone was actually able to get it out to us. I'm ok with it for that reason. We popped it in the oven and for the most part brought it back to life. \n\nOnce it was ready despite the fact that my chicken Parm wasn't up to it's potential, the food was pretty tasty, especially their sauce which had a mild kick and a nice bold flavor. In Italian cooking, the sauce can really make or break the dish, and their's definitely elevated these dishes. I honestly wish their was more,  but that's my only complaint there.\n\nOverall, I feel that Giada's has potential to be 5 stars in my book, but I'll have to reserve that until next time I order. If the food comes hot and bubbly next time, I'll gladly update the review, but for now, it's worth it to try. Their prices, in my opinion, are reasonable, and you get a lot for your money.",509217
2,"This is a kebab shop located on a street full of similar shops, and although you can tell by looking at the kebab meat spinning (even during closed hours) this will not be one of those greasy yet satisfying meals.\nHowever, my desire for greasy got the better of me and I ate here once. The meat was really dry but fatty at the same time (never knew that was possible!) It confuses me how there are always people in here eating. Maybe I don't know the house special?",355959

2,"$48+ for brunch on a Saturday.  about an hour wait.  they text you a little before your table is ready, so you can gamble while you wait.  that's about the only plus about bacchanal.\n\nthe food was such a let down.  yes, there was a large variety, but nothing stood out about any of it.  i tried a little bit of everything hoping to something that blew my mind, but nadas.  \n\nwicked spoon trumps this buffet any day.  the green tea creme brule was the only thing i ate all of. \n\nservice was good, though we did have to track down our servers a few times for refills.  honestly, for 50 bucks i'd much rather go to a different buffet.",570427
1,"Can I give negative stars? \nMy boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said \""here's your check please pay and leave.\"" I said \""Excuse me\"" and he responded \""You are a waste of space at my bar.\"" I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded \""are you serious?\"" All he said was \""Leave\"" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, \""Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway.\"" As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said \""I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!\"" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out? Very questionable service to me.",105616
1,"Just returned from SoCal Fish Taco Co.  Very disappointing.  Decor and design was interesting, server good, but that's where it all ended.  Don't think much was made from scratch.  Everything tasted canned, salsa, weak cocktail sauce (more like regular ketchup) beans, tortillas......EVERYTHING.  \n\nReally wanted to like this place.  No flavor/seasonings ... Boring.  Wish it was different.  Shrimp tacos and grouper tacos had no flavor at all.  Shrimp had watery/boiled texture.  Not worth it.  Missed opportunity for this company.",605626
3,This place is definitely a dive but I can't say its not delicious. The wings aren't as scrawny as most places I go to;they are actually good meaty wings.The hot garlic is probably my favorite sauce because I can't get it anywhere else. The fried zucchini is also awesome. Service and food is great but the atmosphere could use some work.,359171
3,"Seamless Club becomes a dance club at 4 am nightly, or rather, every early morning.  The area in front of the stage becomes a dance floor with the deejay spinning out house music.  It's not a huge space to dance in, but doable.  \n\nWith go-go dancers abound, you'll also have an eyeful of strippers ready to take you on for a private lap dance.  So, as you listen the pulsating beat, keep your eyes opened for boobs and ass everywhere.  There are A LOT of strippers here for your liking, so when you get tired of dancing, take a seat and have someone dance for you.\n\nIt's $20/pp for entry fee alone, free for local ladies and $10 for local guys.  There are passes available somewhere, I just haven't figured out where to get them yet.  (Taxis perhaps?)\n\nThe restrooms are an interesting twist with glass doors that fade dark when you turn the lock. (Just be sure you actually turn the lock completely, otherwise you'll have other patrons watching you pee.)\n\nThere's a huge parking lot with valet and all that costs some change.  You can try to be daring and park over at New Orleans across the way,   find street parking, or park in private lot nearby.  Just watch out for your car.  We were there last weekend and our car was broken into!  =(  That sucked ass!  Save yourself the trouble and just park in the Seamless parking lot I guess. \n\nDress code - I gotta love this!  They let you up in here wearing sneaks or flip flops.  Then again, I'm a girl, so I guess it doesn't really matter all that much.\n\nSidenote: Drinks are expensive!  A bottle of BOSS water or even a Heineken will cost you $9!",236957
5,"AMAZING. \n\nAppetizers: hamachi, foie gras\n\nEntree: lamb rack with three sides: mushroom farro, polenta, and brussels sprouts\n\nDesert: trio of vanilla cake, root beer float and panna cotta. \n\nEverything was absolute perfection. Each dish was better than the last and the service was impeccable.",190453
3,"I thought this place was pretty average as far as Chinese food goes.  Decided to try it out because other reviewers mention the plethora of vegetarian options.  On the menu itself there are no more vegetarian options than most Chinese places offer.  However, they will vegetarian-ize most of the meat dishes (I got General Tso's Tofu).\n\nThat said, it was not the greatest tofu I've had--kind of mushy, sauce was a bit watery (...or oily...honestly I couldn't tell which).  It also was not spicy at all.  I'm sure they'll make it spicier if you ask, so if you like your food spicy you should probably request it.  My food tasted alright and was definitely a generous portion, plenty for leftovers.\n\nService was quick and the place looked clean.  The food was just very...average.",11813
1,"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. This store is such a joke. I've shopped at Best Buy before... not for any major purchases, usually just for CDs or DVDs, never had any problems until now.\n\nI decided to buy a computer from them. Biggest waste of time/money. First of all, their \""computer experts\"" couldn't tell me anything about the computers that wasn't written on the little spec cards on the displays. But i had done my own research, so i thought I was making a good choice. I also bought it \""optimized\"" which is where for $39.99 they have Geek Squad go through and get rid of the programs that you dont need and do all of the updates. \n\nI got home, and right off the bat had problems with the computer. It was shutting off randomly, wasn't downloading programs correctly... pretty much just a bad product. I returned it today, which brings me to...\n\nTheir HORRENDOUS customer service. They checked over the computer and did declare that it was defective. Then they told me that they would refund my money... minus the $39.99 for the optimization, because \""labor charges are non-refundable\"". Well that's great, except for the fact that they sold me a DEFECTIVE product, AFTER I paid them extra to make sure that it wasn't defective! But they really had a hard time understanding that. I had to talk to a salesgirl and two managers, one who had to call a higher up. For $40. come on people. I think I fought with them for a half an hour. They were ridiculously rude, and really had nothing to say except \""it's our policy not to refund labor charges\"". Long story short, I eventually was reimbursed the full amount and was rid of the POS computer. \n\nLast time I EVER shop at ANY Best Buy",315055
2,"I went on a personal recommendation with high hopes for finally finding a stylist in Las Vegas that I can trust. The atmosphere is very high energy. Sal is lovely and very engaging. However, for me the music is a bit too loud (I left with a migraine) and the haircut was not nearly as good as my stylist back East. Too much thinning and texturizing left my wavy hair with frizzy flyaways, no body and tangles. The color is almost the same as before the appointment, no improvement, but thank goodness no disaster either. I couldn't stand to have a bad haircut AND a bad hair color all at once.

4,"Absolutely beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright  inspired hotel where every President since Herbert Hoover has stayed (Obama has yet to make an appearance). We chose to stay in the Octavilla building. Yes, it's far from the parking lot (hence the minus one star) but the rooms are new and spacious - accented with the signature Biltmore blocks in the bathroom and in the headboard. Breakfast at Frank & Alberts was delicious with  organic, locally grown ingredients included on the menu.  Definitely take the time to explore the grounds and the buildings and ask the concierge to sign you up for the historical tour where you can learn about all the amazing architecture and well-known guests and traditions at the Biltmore. To think that the piano in the lobby has been played by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Billy Joel, and Bono! Tip: carry a map of the hotel with you - it's very easy to get lost!",389287

3,My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for our anniversary since everyone recommended it to us. We went here on a Friday night; reservations for 7:30 and we were seated around 7:45. Not bad! It was pretty busy which I expected since it was a Friday. \n\nWhen we were seated our server explained the red side and green side. I noticed all the meat they had and the salad bar. I decided to go to the salad bar before eating some meat. The salad bar looked delicious! I was excited to see that they had lobster bisque as the soup of the day. \n\nThey had a lot of meat to choose from. I wasn't too impressed with some of the meat because some of it was loaded with sodium. The chicken was a little dry and the sausage was just a-ok.,347547
3,"Had our 6 month check up yesterday and it was just ok. The ladies at the front reception are still unfriendly and will actually take phone calls while you are standing right in front of them...even if they were talking to you first. \n\nThe medial technicians don't actually talk TO my baby but will tell me how cute he is and talk to me about him. It would be nice if she interacted with him. She wouldn't even touch him until she had to give him his shots and even then, she didn't actually speak to him. \n\nThey still call me \""Mom\"" even though I've corrected them and asked them to call me by my name. Again, I'm not YOUR Mom and when I've asked you to address me by my name and you still don't, it's obvious that you don't really care about my business. \n\nDr. Pham is great though and does listen but I think this will be our last visit.",117670

4,"Tried Bombay Spice last night. After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts!\n\nIt was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!). \n\n Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations. \n\nWe ordered:\nSomosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty).\nNaan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum)\nGrilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).\n\nWe each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. \n\nI ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).\n\nHusband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home. \n\nNext time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things. \n\n$35 before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. We'll definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us.",320246

2,"Food was excellent. Price is high but not overpriced. Presentation was outstanding. \n\nWines were in fact overpriced.

Come on guys get your act together!\n\nService was very good once we we actually waited on. 7 minutes from the time we sat down. There were only 2 tables in the place that had customers. No excuse for that! \nThe decor was great, the only complaint would be the floors were so sick my chair was constantly sliding thought the night.

Seasonal offerings can also be found, such as Easter Bunny photos and the like.  \n\nThe negative here can be the parking lot and busy nature of the plaza. Since they are one of the only major plazas in the area, they are usually really busy and the parking lot can prove difficult to navigate and you may have to park and walk a bit.\n\nOverall: A\nGreat variety of shops and dining.  See a movie and make a date night out of it!  Leave yourself time for parking if need to be at something at a certain time!",212312
1,"Great stadium to watch a game. Went to camp to see practice, ordered a hot dog which took almost 15 minutes! What would happen if there were 60,000 people? The concessions are the worst I have experienced - MICHAEL BIDWELL listen to your fans, big fix needed",205809
2,Food was a-OK..not bad...; We ordered take out and it was nice to have parking spaces up front for the take out orders.\nHubby ordered the sea clams and specifically asked for two sauces - the red sauce and the tartar sauce.  The host said they always put the two sauces in there.  We got home and there was only the red sauce.  I called them and I told the host that the hubby was not happy....she laughs.... This was the SECOND time!  and to have a the host laugh at the situation did not help.  \nI had the mussels in the garlic white wine sauce which was tasty and plentiful.  I also ordered the hearty house salad.\nThe low rating was due to the host laughing at us.... what was that all about???,612679
2,"Went to Villalpando's with some friends because they like this restaurant.  I had no idea where it was, until we got there.  It's located at Chandler Blvd just east of I-10.  Years ago, it was a sports bar filled with TV's, but they are long gone.  I don't eat anything green (except peas), so finding something to eat there was a chore.  I normally have a red chili beef burrito when I go to a Mexican restaurant, but they only had green chili.  I ended up eating a bean and cheese burrito, which was very good.\n\nI agree with the other reviews of this place... it's not bad, but not great. I'm sure my friends would disagree.  They love it.  The prices are fantastic.  For the beer drinkers, no beer on tap.  Only bottles.  Unlike the sports bar, I hope they survive, because the place was dead on a Friday night.",327249
1,"This store seems to be very hit and miss. I had ordered a 2 tiered wonder woman cake and it was perfect and I loved it. If it had been that experience alone I would have given them 5 stars but unfortunately it is not. I also ordered a lady gaga cake and this one missed the mark. The fondant it's lumpy and the piping it's extremely uneven. When I called to voice my disappointment the decorator Jay would not have it. He changed the cake was perfect and that if I wanted a specific look I should have agreed for it.  I will post pictures of the cake and what I feel the problem areas are. Sadly, I will find a new cake shop BC of his reaction and the quality.\n\n**UPDATE 8-6-14**\nSomeone from KAK has been harassing me on Yelp sending me messages as to question the validity of my statements. Claiming that I must have left the cake in the sun or that for some reason the quality of the cake is my own fault. Truth is I was unable to confront Jay face to face because I was uncomfortable with that but made sure to call him as soon as I left the store. The cake was kept cool under the AC in my brand new car and at no time had extreme exposure to the AZ heat. Jay had told me that the fondant was still soft because he had just finished the cake, mind you I ordered it nearly a month in advance. Never will I ever deal with this establishment and I will make sure that no one I know will go to this place.",371117
5,"As a former patient for my entire childhood, I'm offering a little bit of a different type of review here, but I visited PDS since their Mesa office off of Dobson rd.  As an adult I sometimes wish I were still able to visit PDS because the Dr.'s, hygenists and assistants were always so great!

1,"Went the first time, unbelievable eyebrow waxing and pedicure. Been busy with work and school, and really didn't have the time to take care of me. Had a free day yesterday and decided it'd be time to relax and visit again.... waited outside 45 minute because the sign out front was chipped and appear to say 10:00 am - but in reality must be 11... once 11 rolled around, a few older ladies showed up and ran with their walkers to the front door. After waiting 45 minutes I was rudely cut in line by 3 older ladies (and I do have respect for my elders), but cannot even begin to express my disgust for the staff who immediately sat them down in pedicure chairs and tended to them while blatantly ignoring me.

It is a sports book bar, so it can get crazy during games. Not the quieter, serious gamers only experience! \nService is hit or miss, which shouldn't be the case. Often, they don't have enough staff during busy times. But, staff is usually quite friendly. There's lot of seating throughout the sports book, and one nicer area has comfy big red chairs. A good spot to enjoy a 99 cent margarita, which is only served at the Sports Book!",515249
1,We drove all the way from Raleigh (3 hour drive) to eat at this place. We came at 9:00pm thirty minutes before closing. There were quite a few customers in there at the time. As we walked in an older lady shouted we are closed to us and shoo-ing us out the door. We were all upset and about to leave then she throws a paper at us telling us hurry up and order standing there rushing us saying come on hurry up and order. We did not drive all the way to charlotte for this kind of service so we left and didn't even get to eat. We did not appreciate being rushed and forced to order something quickly especially if it's our first time here.,157461

1,"If I could give this place no stars, I would. We placed an order online under the impression that we were paying $60 for 4 rolls. What we got instead was 16 pieces. DON'T BUY FROM THEM. They will rip you off. When we called to complain, the manager, Dave, was rude, unsympathetic that their website was misleading, and tried to blame the delivery company for making the order wrong. Talk about misplaced blame and unaccountability. Horrible business and even worse customer service.",65204

5,Such a wonderful relaxing evening. They have a nice little waiting room with champagne and different teas.

I was told by a rude salesperson and an even more rude manager that I did not qualify for the 04 ford expedition I went to see before I was even given an opportunity to test drive. After leaving highly upset I stopped down the road at City Chevrolet where I was greeted by a courteous sales professional by the name of Avon Spann \""THE CHEVY MANN\"". Not only did he get me in a 2014 vehicle which I didn't qualify for as far as ford was concerned. But he treated me so well I don't want to buy cars from anyone or anywhere else.

I got pepperoni and sausage an it tasted like cardboard, and felt like it as well. Also, if it says \""breadsticks\"" on the menu, usually this means more than 1.

3,"If you love fried chicken & chicken wings, you'll enjoy this place! I decided to check this place out when I had a craving for some chicken wings and honestly BWW just doesn't do it for me. Ironically, this location was across the street from BWW so thought eh what the heck, I'll try it. \n\nOnce we arrived it was dead! However, that didn't discourage me from trying this place. Looking at the menu, the AYCE is the best deal. At first, I was a little confused on how the process worked since the hostess/cashier/waitress really didn't explain it. But in the end I was ok with it. After an hour, then service picked up.\n\nSo enough with the fluff, let's get down to business. These little suckers are huge! Seriously the first basket with 10 pieces will get you full. Make sure to split the order with 2 flavors so you can sample at least 2 different sauces. After the first basket, each basket comes with 5. And nothing says awesome like $1 PBR to wash down the wings. For a minute there, I felt like I was a competitive eater as I raced to beat the 12-yr old kid that kept eating wings. Unfortunately I paid for it after 30 some wings.\n\nWe seriously tried every flavor - sesame soy started off good but by the 3 wing, I need something to drink. It became salty and the sauce was thick. The Garlic Parm wasn't bad but honestly just tasted like fried chicken. I love sweet chili but they didn't put enough sauce on these suckers. Remember folks, if chicken is battered and deep fried, more sauce is needed than usual especially when the sauce is thin. The hot sauces were pretty similiar to Hooters. Overall, if you're a fan of Hooters, you'll enjoy this place. It's quieter, $1 beers and big screens to keep you entertained. Plus as Stephanie mentioned freshly brewed tea!",501027
5,"I'm visiting from LA, where we may have a good sushi place or two.  But I found this restaurant on Yelp, and off I went, thinking I'd look more toward meat items, as I'd eaten at another sushi restaurant the night before.  When I pulled up to the restaurant, admittedly I was a bit worried, because the signage made me think cookie cutter strip mall Japanese restaurant.  (Usually, when I think Japanese restaurant in a strip mall, I feel more comfortable if it looks like a dive.)  But generic outside appearance aside, this restaurant holds its own with some of the top restaurants of its kind in LA, and brought to mind restaurants like Wa and the original Katsu-ya.  I began with a house specialty, yellowtail sashimi with just enough tempura jalapeno in a garlic and yuzu-based sauce, before moving on to beef tataki, seared to a beautiful texture with a garlic chili oil.  Both were delicious and perfectly tender.  From there, the chef came out--it was wonderful to get such personal attention (and the restaurant was quite busy)--and we discussed what I might want next.  He suggested I try a white sea bass he had just gotten in, and then a trio of taro tostadas, each a combination of a different fish, spice (as in heat) and avocado cream.  They were fabulous small bites.  I finished my meal with the signature miso marinated black cod, perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful, accompanied with a yuzu-based vinaigrette that complemented it perfectly.\n\nMy primary server was quite attentive and personable (as were all the others), the setting is unpretentious and comfortable, and I didn't know until the end that Chef had graciously given me the white sea bass and tostada tastings.  That was just the cherry on top of an exceptional meal.  It won't be the cheapest Japanese meal you've ever had (though the prices are very fair for what you get, and there are good deals to be had at happy hour and lunch), and if you're a quantity over quality person, there are probably better choices, but if you appreciate top quality, extremely fresh ingredients handled deftly by a talented chef, this is your restaurant.  Even if it were in LA, Soho would still be a standout.  Next time I'm in Vegas, this will be at the top of my list.",620164
2,Got a great deal via Hotel Tonight so it's off to Imperial Palace. From scanning review here I wasn't expecting much and my expectations were met. The place needs a refresh badly though they seem to try and keep it clean. It took 90 minutes to check in on Sunday afternoon. They were nice enough to pass out small bottles of water but I would have preferred adding more staff to get everyone checked in. The woman that checked me in was friendly and helpful but not very speedy. With the line as ugly as it was you'd think they'd try to keep the chit chat down. When I was done with my 90 minutes in purgatory I noticed the line was even longer than when I hit the door. I'm betting some folks were easily in for a 2 hour wait.\n\nThe room was okay with carpet needing replacement but the room was clean given the poor overall condition of the infrastructure. I'd stay here again if the rate was cheap enough but I wouldn't go out of my way to book a room here. You can't beat the overall value given the location on the strip and the normal cheap rates they've been putting out.,167027
4,"One of the better dining experiences you'll have in Pittsburgh. The prices are high, but balanced with a pleasant dining area, lots of menu options and daily specials, and what might be the most friendly and accommodating staff I've ever encountered.\nI've no complaints about the food. I've had dishes that I'm taken back by with complex flavor and presentation and others that simply meet expectations for what a good meal should be, but nothing has ever been bad. Not everything is knock-my-socks off though, so 4 stars. You can't go wrong with the seafood here. Scallops are probably my favorite. \nFinish your meal with a toasted almond cake and a spanish coffee (beware the massive amount of brandy snuck into this) and be fortunate enough for the owner to consider you worthy of a complimentary43 aperitif and you've just had a very good start to your classy night out!",522495
3,"This place has a ton of flat screens around the bar and throughout the restaurant, with a huge projection screen in another raised enclave.  There is an outdoor bar with surrounding tables but I didn't notice any tv screens outside.  The seats @ the indoor bar suck, so I lobbied for a booth.  (The bar seats were like retro, high chairs that lacked a back you could lean into a lil too high, even for my legs).\n\nHappy hour included a few 1/2 priced appetizers that the waitress highlighted.  She also provided a thorough explanation of speechless communication that would ensure our miller lites continued.  If you face the empty bottle @ the end of the table with the label facing outward, she'd pick up the empties for replacement.  I only forgot about this rule once & received a fresh bottle while I still had a 1/4 bottle left.\n\nNo clue how much the beers were but the deal seemed pretty good, since we had @ least 10 beers & an appetizer for $30.  The folks there seemed to run a tidy & expedient little operation and overall my experience was a'ight.",322151

2,"I met friends here on the suggestion of Happy Hour eats n drinks. Arriving to the restaurant there were only 2 parking spots open and they were behind the beer truck that was blocking them, next to a foul smelling dumpster and gas tanks sitting out in the open. \nIt was about 4:15pm on a Tuesday. \nI parked and entered and found the ambiance pleasant. I would recommend some blinds for the atrium seating so that during sunset your customers arent in a greenhouse.\n The server was exceptionally polite and helpful and attentive. He even escorted me to the ladies room and advised me they were unisex. He was just a peach! \nThe unisex bathroom however, reeked of urine. There's a reason ladies prefer their own lavatory! \nStructurally speaking, and this is being really picky, when you wash your hands in their unique sink, the faucet sits so low to the basin that your hands come close to dragging in the dirty basin that others have used. Icky. \nOnce the last minutes of happy hour grew near though, our server's attention, understandably, waned. They got slammed. Perhaps a drink runner for that last hour of happy hour would have aided us in getting our drinks BEFORE closing out AND paying our tabs. \nThe food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd, they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections. They fell flat.\n I then ordered the olive medley and a bread loaf which they purportedly bake on site. The olives were plentiful and tasty. The bread however was burnt. It had big empty holes in the middle so the amount of bread was slight. \nOur cocktails were also unique, however some of them fell flat while others were so immensely strong we had to send 1 or 2 back. \nThe reason i will never return to St. Francis isnt even any of the above although it contributes. But the icing, the cherry on top was departing the joint. \nNow I get why these hipster trendspots hire valet companies. The need to \""accommodate\"" the customer who drives, is hopefully met by an attendant who crams your car into a packed lot meant for only about 16 cars. \nWhen I arrived there was no valet to squeeze me into my spot behind the beer truck, next to the dumpster, near the gas tanks. But when I left my car was again blocked in, this time by other cars which had been sandwiched between my rear and the cars in the lanes behind mine. \nit took quite the effort and my passenger getting out to guide me, to get out of my spot safely.\nOn my exit, backwards, through the lot and around a corner, only then did I notice the valets. One was running about, the other seemed  a bit oblivious, flustered. I rolled down my window, and said \""You guys have to be kidding the way you block people in, \"" I said smiling, trying to make light of the situation. \n\""Most people know.\"" he replied.\n\""Know what?\"" I asked.\n\""To let us know.\""\nConfused, I wasnt sure what he meant. \nMy passenger said \""You guys blocked her in and she could barely get out.\""\nThe attendant responded, \""Look lady, that's the name of the game.\""\nMy passenger said \""What game is that?\""\nHe replied sarcastically, \""Well if you've ever been to St. Francis...\""\n\""I have not\"" I cut him off as he continued to try to explain that we should have known to come let them know so they could move cars to let us out. \n1st of all, from my spot I couldnt see that there was even a valet set up.\n2nd of all- to get your attention then to wait for you to rubix cube cars around would have inconvenienced me, YOUR CUSTOMER AND THE PATRON OF THE RESTAURANT THAT HIRES YOUR DUMB ASS TO CAR JOCKEY! \nTo which i replied \""I have not been here before and I wont be back now\"" to which he replied\n\""Well good \"" and rolled his eyes.\nSt Francis- the valet is the first and last impression of your restaurant. And that is why, more than anything else, I wont be back and I try to avoid places that use valets b/c they are too cheap to buy extra land to accommodate the numbers their trendy new spot might bring in. Additionally 9and not in your case since our drinks were priced for happy hour) my money that pays for inflated bar and food prices should cover me for FREE PARKING and not to have to pay or even tip some juvenile dipshit whom I wouldnt let drive my car if he was my own relative!",250256

After trying it and thanking him, he then told her to \""come back when she was ready to buy\"", in an \""I'm not taking you seriously\"" kind of manner. Not once was he the least bit friendly or did he even crack a smile. That is the last time we will visit that particular store. Poor customer service or was he just having a bad day (although the store had just opened and there was no one else around!)? Never again!",267684
1,Frequently get take out from this place. Food usually fairly decent. Except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container.

3,"If you're headed there for  the lunch hour, you probably should put your \""out of office\"" on your email because you'll be there for at least the next two hours. \n\nAlas, when I saw that there was a lunch special (about $10 for a half salad and pizza), I figured it would be a relatively typical lunch hour. Usually places that have lunch specials abide by the 1-hour lunch rule, but definitely not this place--at least, not in this instance. Holy moly, I had no idea that it took so long to make salad and pizza at Humble Pie. I am a regular at Sauce Pizza + Wine, and it usually takes them about 3 minutes to bring my salad after ordering, then another 5 minutes to have my pizza out. I think we were about 45 minutes into being at Humble Pie when our salads were brought out. I think my coworker was about ready to eat his shirt at that point.\n\nAlright, so how good was this hyped up place? Well...it was ok. First, I was a little surprised that the restaurant was small and the tables were kind of cramped, but I guess that adds to the ambiance of being a humble place. I ordered the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was OK, but not very flavorful. It kind of tasted like a salad I'd make at home. My pizza was a standard pepperoni, to which I added on olives. The pepperoni is the smaller diameter style pepperoni found at some other specialty pizza joints like Grimaldi's. It was uber salty and greasy, which felt very sinful as I was eating it. I think there was enough pepperoni on the pizza to cover 2 or 3 pizzas, actually. The crust, cheese and sauce were good, however. I suppose I should have ordered a veggie pizza or something a little less meaty to enjoy my meal.\n\nOverall, the food was OK, but nothing out of the ordinary special that I'd die to take my friends to. At least the service is pretty good (aside from the kitchen being super low), so I suppose I'd be OK with going back and giving it another shot...on a weekend.",364875

People are happy and it is working perfectly. Other companies we used to help us before were not professionally up to speed on the CRAFT of the business.\n\n4.

That is the key.  \n\n6.  Urgent again - Called them to the house again as I was having a party in four hours during the heat of the Summer at 109 degrees outside. I was cooking and using the ovens inside!  4 hours before the party, I was setting the temp down low to cool the house as we were going to have a ton of people. The temperature was not working and one air con unit was not coming on..... The house and I were getting HOT.  Why now and why on a weekend again!!!!

This was great service especially when some places are shady!\n\nWhen we were done, they had an AMAZING changing stations!  Their showers were VERY clean and hospitable; offered every amenity you need to freshen up!!!!\n\nI would definitely come back here to play another round!  The flight is worth it!!!!",102220
5,"I've been to may steak houses in many cities, usually ordering a NY Sirloin. But I've never had a steak as good as I did at Botero this past week. I ordered it rare/med rare and it was done perfectly. Warm red inside with a seared exterior, perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper. The size was very generous and it was well trimmed. I just had a side of mushrooms that was enough for 2 or 3. If there was one complaint, wine by the glass was limited with just one Cabernet at $25. Other red wines were under $20.",366207
4,"No frills mexican...this is your spot!  Love it!  They have amazing greasy chips with lots of different sauces to try out.  I pretty much made a meal out of that.  We got the veggie fajitas and split it.  I liked that there were so many different veggies in it.  The price you cannot beat it.  It was so cheap.  The lights are REALLY bright but other than that, not much to complain about.  The staff was super nice and we just had some cervezas to drink.  Next time I head down to the Paign...I might have to go back to Mas amigos....",381688
4,"Great neighborhood venue but needs to work through its kitchen and service issues.  Only open about a week.  Restaurant is nicely updated and inviting.  Back patio is open and lively.  Food was good once you got it.  Our server was great and manager, once he appeared, appropriately apologetic.  Comped a meal and gave us a dessert.  I want them to be successful so we will certainly give them another chance.\n\nSo we went the next night with other friends.  Like I said, we really want this restaurant to be successful.  Service was somewhat better, course we had the attention of the manager.  Still got some things to work out...its slow and forgetful.  The food is quite good.  We sat on the patio which is great.  As we were leaving about 8:30 - 3 bus loads of ASU college students were arriving.  OMG!.  They are not prepared for that kind of crowd yet.  I'm sure they had a good time anyway.\n\nI'm upgrading my rating to 4stars.  I've been there 5 times and each time service gets better and better.  Food is always very good. My husband had a pork chop that was heaven on earth.  It's not on the menu any more but ask.  Drinks are now coming quickly and they haven't forgotten anything (ok except for the apples on the apple Gorgonzola salad which was more hysterical than anything) in the last 2 visits.  We live a hop, skip and a jump away so it's becoming \""our place\"".   Give it a try.",592620
2,"The food was very impressive.  The experience was what ruined the entire evening.  The noise level was quite loud, but nothing that I haven't experienced before.  We made a reservation and were really looking forward to some great sushi.  We ordered edamame to start with, the Samba Sushi Chef's Selection and a dragon roll.  The waitress recommended we get more, even though we had already run through the menu with her and settled on what we would be ordering.  The edamame arrived, and seriously 30 seconds later all the sushi made its way to the table.  We maybe spent 30 total minutes at the restaurant.  It was a overall a really unfortunate experience, and had it not been for the food, it would have been truly awful.",312520
2,"came here last night and service was so slow but the place was empty.  the nachos are the ballpark cheesy kind.  i prefer the shredded cheese type on my nachos.  the wings- good. again, just come here for wings and you may have to wait for the waitress to come over for a long long time.",243398
2,"I had to wait a few days to write this because I'm so angry at being duped by these near perfect reviews. Came in at about 2 pm and, while you could still get breakfast, you could not get pasta dishes. It was breakfast or sandwiches - big disappointment. Apparently you can only get pasta after 3 pm. \n\nI ended up ordering a bunch of random stuff because my planned meal for me and kiddos was foiled. We had the potato soup (pretty average), a chicken parm sandwich (portion small and doesn't come with pasta like the other sandwiches), grilled cheese (average), and pancakes (average). \n\nThe service was lackluster and the restaurant has that smell when you enter a rest home. No thanks. \n\nI will forever be perplexed as to how this place is categorized as being good. It wasn't anything I couldn't get any where else.",253649
5,"I drink coffee like it's my job. Columbia Street Roastery is definitely the place to go to buy coffee or espresso beans. Not to mention, SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS! \n\nThey carry a variety of flavors, decaf / caf, blends ...and there are quite a few choices when it comes to Fair Trade or Organic.  \n\nLooking for something to do on a Saturday? They offer tours of the plant. And complimentary tastes!   \n\nDuring the summer months, they have a booth setup at the Lincoln Square Mall's Farmers Market too.",271067
3,"So there I was with no ticket or even a poor soul to drag along with me but I was determined to see the resplendent Walter Schreifels & Band. A cheeky face value ticket from the support act, you say? That'll do nicely thanks. (Aside; I abhor the middleman that comes with booking online so from now on I'm going through the actual acts themselves. Stick it to the Man, man!) \nClose to Waverley Station and nought but a short walk over North Bridge. It's got a nice cosy cave-like feel to it, ideal for gigs. Now I've not been on a 'night out' here and to be honest I'm not exactly bothered by that. Dark nooks & crannies are my favourite spots but no need to take a sudden deep interest in your shoes; your fellow patrons are friendly and it's not hard to strike up a pleasant conversation here. \nThere's one thing I really dislike about Cabaret Voltaire though and I think it puts a dampener on things; come 10pm, no matter, the place gets cleared out for a club night at 11pm. It's like your parents coming home annoyingly early and chucking your pals out. As well as you. And the entertainment. Uncool in my opinion. \n\nA-OK-and a half.",357765

Montr\u00e9al has the best breakfast resto in da world. I enjoyed every minute of it. Kinda on pricey side but well worth it. I also order a bowl of cafe latte and it was delicious.

2,"I like a menu that has limited choices. However, if you're menu is limited then what you make needs to be outstanding. Both of our burgers were dry as were the buns. The egg on my burger was over hard. In all my times of ordering a \""dirty\"" burger, I've never had the egg fried hard. The point of the egg is for the yolk to soak into the bun and run over the meat. The truffle fries were a miss with the sauce tasting more like an Alfredo. We ended up sending them back and asking for plain fries suggesting maybe they were soggy because they sat too long. Server was pleasant and the wine was good. We won't return.",572850

2,"I would have to say that my husband and I didn't enjoy our experience here, we ordered two po boy sandwiches and two fountain drinks and the total bill was almost $30.00, for that price we could've had a sit down dinner and not fast food creole. As we ate, the server's children ran rampant through the restaurant, and there was discussion about whether she or her mother were going to be working or taking care of the children the following day. Then my husband walked up to the counter to get me a to go container and while he was talking to her, she answers her cell phone and practically ignores him. Terrible service and atmosphere, the po boys were actually good but not worth $10-13 a piece. We thought they had made a mistake on our bill when we saw it was $27.00, that's pricey for fast food sandwiches!",364027

Had Kenny do flowers and never seen them as well done as Kenny did.  KUDOS to Misa's Salon.",249825
3,"I've gone to Dragon Fly twice now.  Once on a blind date and once with my partner and kids.  The blind date experience was okay; thank God they have $5 martinis-of-the-day.  \n\nMy return visit with my partner (not the blind date) and his kids was more enjoyable, but still nothing spectacular.  Dragon Fly offers your basic Chinese dishes that you'd find on a Chinese take-out menu, but they serve them to you in their dining room.  Good, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nOur server wasn't very attentive until the very end when we didn't want him to be.  We were seated and brought some of those crunchy Chinese noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard sauce.  With five of us, they were gone in no time and we never did see a refill.  And I liked that they had a $5 sour apple martini drink special, but my 2nd martini didn't come until I was done eating my meal.  It kind of ruins the excitement of drinking a martini when it's served as dessert.  Well...mostly.  Toward the end of the meal (not at the end, but toward the end), our server started clearing our dishes off our table before we were even finished!   My partner had turned away for a second and someone scarfed up his plate with some food still on it.  This infuriated my partner, but I, surprisingly, wasn't as bothered.  Maybe it was because I knew that \""dessert\"" was coming?  \n\nAt any rate, the food is average, drink specials on martinis are great, and the service is slow, but keep an eye on your plate.  It'll disappear before your very eyes!",212511
3,"Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\n\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \n\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.",869

3,"I have to agree with the other yelpers. I am a huge carnitas fan and the carnitas here are really good. They come with good basic rice and beans and fresh homemade tortillas, and the guacamole is fresh made and tasty. I really liked the chips, salsa, and the bean dip served at the beginning. The shredded beef tacos are good too.\n\nSome of the other things are a miss....the chimichangas are bad...from the shrimp and the chicken they are just bland.\n\nService is good and our server pepe was great.\n\nI would go again...although I think san francisco has better mexican food.",305093

Heist Brewery might just be the biggest beer thing going (for now).\n\nHeist has taken the craft-brewery tasting room concept and blown it out into a full-scale restaurant and bar. The beer is decent (nothing special), but the food is the star here. Lots of unique dishes and healthy options--it's hard to decide what to eat.\n\nWe came for an early dinner over Labor Day weekend and sat out on the deck (dog-friendly!) where a live band was playing. We were in a slightly hungover state so lots of fried stuff for us and it was all very tasty and in satisfying portions.\n\nOverall a great experience at Heist and looking forward to returning.",560641

Four girlfriends and I ordered the vegetarian exclusive (I believe it's called) which is meant for three people, so we also ordered the vegetarian platter meant for one. We hardly finished the exclusive, there was so much food! Everything is SO tasty. I was worried about the injera, as I have friends who don't like the consistency of it. I really loved the fresh sourdough taste of it, though, especially mixed with the flavors of the different wats. \n\nAfter my first visit, I was so excited to take my boyfriend there - we made dinner plans with friends of ours within two weeks of my first trip! I absolutely LOVE Lalibela and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite stops for delicious vegetarian food!",110479

After waiting 30 minutes (with no bread on our tables), they finally took our cocktail orders.  30 minutes later came the cocktails and some breadsticks.  The cocktails were delicious, but small pours .. and we not even given the opportunity more until 30 minutes later, when the waitress finally came out to take our dinner menu.  I ordered exactly what she recommended as their best - the tagliatelle and the hake.  The tagliatelle was very good, but anything would be that good drowned in a stick of butter - I'd give it a 4 out of 5 though on taste.  Then, the hake.  I can 100% tell you that this was the worst fish I have ever ever ever had.  It was completely tasteless and they paired it with really subtle vegetables like fennel.  Sooo unbelievably unimpressed.  Dessert was delicious - 5 out of 5.   After all was said and done, our two course meal + dessert took 3.5 hours!!  This restaurant serious needs to buff up its service and fix that hake.",455921
1,"This is my second order, and by accident. I ordered from them months ago and swore never again. \n\nBut it just so happened that I get so many flyers on my door that this one slipped through. \n\nFirst things first. I ordered pork and veg. And chicken and veg for myself as I only eat chicken fish and turkey. Reason I say that is because I received chicken and veg, with shrimp and veg. Guess who's deathly allergic to shrimp.\n\nThe food was bland, dry and Luke warm. The fried rice is the worst I ever tasted. Salty, and dry. And not even that nice Brown nutty color of fried rice, I almost thought it was spoiled food. \n\nThe lady on the phone said she heard me say I wanted shrimp, that's a lie I'm not suicidal and don't have an eppi pen. Why would I order shrimp lady.\n\nAlso she was giggling when I asked her if she got a lot of complaints. I didn't check yelp before I placed my order, if I had this would all have been avoided.\n\nShe offered to refund my money forty min ago. If she does I will post it later, if she doesn't I will go postal. I only wish I paid with a credit card so I could dispute this, and not worry about a refund.

3,"I have pretty much come to the conclusion that these wings are the fast food of wings. Not that they try to present themselves otherwise but I just get a very generic feel from these wings.\n\nI will say that the service at this location is top notch. The cashier taking orders was very nice and made sure to clarify what I had ordered before she put the order in. I ordered three chicken strips with original hot sauce and fries with a side of cheese sauce. The strips were just okay. I would not go out of my way to order them again. The fries were the same. The cheese sauce that came with them was overall pretty bland. My true issue lies with the amount of salt that is used in everything here. Way too much salt. It became overpowering halfway through my meal. As one of the other reviewers said, I could also taste sugar in the fries which is just completely unnecessary. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back to Wing Stop. There are certainly many other better alternatives for wings in the area. I might consider trying something else here but not any time soon.",627349

As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly. \n\nIt has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.\n\nHowever, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present. \n\nAdd to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.\n\nHistory was already \""meh,\"" and now #lunchfail.

Then, in the awesome bathroom, I dropped my hairbrush on the floor, and when I bent down to get it, there were 4 Xanax on the floor, under the vanity.  Neither of the above items were mine; we had just checked in.  I asked to change rooms and a room upgrade, and they told me that would be difficult.  They put an equal room on hold for me, but I couldn't get into it until 6pm the FOLLOWING day.   Really more of a hassle to move rooms.  Then, later in my stay, as I was walking from the shower to my room, I sliced the bottom of my foot open on a carpet staple/nail that was loose.  Hurts like hell.   Since I had already officially \""checked out\"" online early that morning, they wouldn't do anything about that.   For all of this, in a 48 hour stay, after talking with the management for a day and a half, they finally offered me a $100 credit on anything inside the hotel.  $100 does not buy 1 show ticket, or 1 spa treatment.  I still had to spend more money there.   I could not use $100 on food, since I was at a work conference. Some BS if you ask me.

We all moan and groan about it because there are a hundred other things you'd rather be doing for 3hrs. \nHowever, I've been going to Heart Savers for quite a few years now and they have managed to streamline their system pretty well. When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix. \nThe instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category. \nThe hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.\n Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually.\nThose of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years!\nOne note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.  But I heard cheaper rates being quoted in class, as well as higher ones (you pay once you get to class).",536287

There is hardly room to move around or even to sit if there are more than a hand full of people there, and since it became crowded quickly after we arrived we just felt like getting out of there. It's a cute little space, but there was nothing fabulous about it to me. My hot chocolate and pastry were okay, but I don't know that I'd return.

I scheduled a move and called back a bunch of times, leaving unreturned messages to ensure it was scheduled and that they had received my signed contract.

The two plates of bread they brought out for the table of 15 were long gone and we hadn't ordered any food yet so we asked for the manager.  His rude and defensive response has to be one of the worst I've ever witnessed.  My brother was so annoyed he asked the guy to walk away.  When the food arrived it was sub par.  It certainly wasn't as good as it used to be.  The Mac n cheese was dry and flavorless, our meatballs were bland, we got about half as many padron peppers as we used to.  My shrimp ceviche was served on a different plate then it used to be leaving my tortilla chips to sit in the juice and become soggy.  Thank goodness we had the best company and we were able to laugh and still enjoy the night.  I will not be back...ever",555432
1,I have been a loyal customer for over 3 years from this place and recently their food sux and their customer service is awful. Not only their prices are outrageous the cashiers don't know how to be polite and are very rude. We are done and they get a big F.,379205
4,Their facility was clean and the girls cutting hair seemed very professional. I needed a place that was open late and could get me in and out - This place did just that.,368127
4,"One of the better Costco's in the area, but the self-checkout loses the chance for 5 stars.  Ridiculous set up and if you don't set the stuff down properly on the belt, it comes back to you and you have to wait for someone to come over and clear the program so you can start over again.  Would rather just stand in one of the long lines and let someone check me out.",262751
4,"First I have to say in the capitol of AYCE sushi this place has some of the best appetizers, and small plates anywhere. If any place has my beloved shishito peppers I am a happy girl.\nAmbiance is bright, fun and immaculate. they have music videos as well as sports on multiple tv's, but the room never gets loud or annoying. \nService is great. Even when they are swamped they make sure every single guest is happy and attended to. One of the GM's even hopped behind the sushi bar to assist me on his night off! I ale saw the owner running food for the kitchen, talk about a passionate team!\nTheir nigiri was exceptional! My favorite was the hamachi toro, saba (the best I've had), and the uni was incredible. \nI would love to go back on a slow night so I can truly be blown away.",261354
1,Very bad service. They don't show up and are difficult to reach. Do not risk using these for your pool !,255559
4,Love it here. The food was great and had anazing service. Will be back again! Everyone was so poliet and greeted us with a smile.,1053
3,"Food is okay but so over rated, thai restaurant in same shopping center should try. \nI probably will not come back, service is ok",154179
1,"terrible service!  the only advantage of this liquor store is it's close to the strip.  I went there to buy some liquor on a friday night and after I left the store, I couldn't find my phone.  So I called my cellphone to see if it's somewhere in my car.  The phone wasn't shut off and it wasn't in my car.  So I decided to call back the liquor store.  the person said they didn't find any phone.  Then I asked if I can come back and check myself.  The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.  And just to be fair to them, I clearly remembered talking on the phone with one of my friends before heading over to the liquor store.  So the chance that I lost my phone in the liquor store is very highly! On top of that, the liquor is ghetto as hell and doesn't have plastic cup for customers.  What kinda of a liquor store is it if it doesn't even have cups?\nDon't go there if you don't want to lose your phone !",65640
3,"If you go in for theme restaurants,this one is tops. A neat place to take people--if you can,ask to sit inside one of the boats!  Kids love this place.But be forewarned-if you are having a nice lunch or dinner in one of the 'boats',you may get some uninvited company in the form of rambunctious children who don't belong to you wanting to play on it(We did!!) -but that's more about the parents of said children.\nThis is definitely a fun place-nice bar,and a store attached when you are done eating or waiting to do so. Overall, I think the drinks are good,the food is fine,-it's good,just not great. The nachos are huge,as in tall. I've had better food-it's a bit more hype than substance in some ways. The wait staff seems to be very friendly.",298700
3,"We went here a few months ago to celebrate my coming to Charlotte.  It is a pricey upscale casual restaurant - I think we walked out after all was said and done at well over 100 a piece, but it was worth it for the one-time experience.  The dining room was open and decorated to look like an outdoor patio of an Italian villa.  Service was excellent.  I was surprised how down home the cooking was... especially the sides - we had scalloped potatoes and green beans - both southern style.  The potatoes were out of this world, and we joked if we ever went back we would just order sides.  I had the lobster and scallops and my bf had steak - they were both good but we both said after wards that we felt like we had had better.  I don't know, I guess for the price we both expected to have our socks blown off, but that wasn't the case at least with the entrees.  I don't think I will go back because we left with that feeling.  That being said, I have heard nothing but rave reviews of Noble's so maybe it was just our experience...",82845
4,"We stayed in the hotel, therefore the price of admission for the Tower was included for us. \nThus, we went up three times and tried the bigshot. Anyone who dares should not miss this attraction. At its best it is at night. Seemingly you are hanging in mid-air, because you can no more see the tower below you. Although it costs $ 15, it is definitely worth it. \nA night visit to the tower is also recommendable because you can enjoy a great view of the lights of this fascinating city from more than a hundert stories above.",292109
1,"My first visit to Cadillac Ranch Las Vegas location was very disturbing. It revealed a culture of disrespect highlighted by inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. This culture of disrespect seemed to be fully reinforced by management who did not care to listen or address our immediate complaints.  Certainly such behaviors have a negative effect on Cadillac Ranch's profits and reputation, so I thought it worthwhile to address corporate management.\n\nEvidently, our bartender, Rachel (Bar3-t8), was not happy with the 10% tip we provided.  We were $1.50 short of 20% but we were not happy with her poor service.  She was belligerent loudly calling us \""Cheap ass mofos\"",  instructing security to \""get them out of here, they don't deserve to finish their drinks\"", and proclaiming, \""this is my bar, don't come back.\""  We sat their dumb founded that she would treat customers with such disrespect. We quietly left the bar area to seek the manager.\n\nOur group of four never imagined or has ever experienced such disrespect. After spending $25 as entrance fee, $25 for hookah, and $29.23 at the bar,  a total of $79.23, we wanted to let the manager know we felt we paid too much for  the insults. However, to make matters worse, we were informed by an assistant manager, that the manager \""was busy counting money\"" so we were to take his business card instead. Evidently, while he had time to count our $79.23, he did not have enough time to tend to our concerns.\n\nAs we make our complaints to Yelp, the BBB and the corporate office of Cadillac Ranch we are left wondering what sort of abuse we might have experienced if we left no tip. Are tips required even for unsatisfactory service? \n\nIt also begs the question, \""Is this behavior condoned by corporate management?\""  Or, \""Will we get some meaningful action from corporate?\"" I know from running my own business and having worked at a Fortune 500 company that substantive changes do not happen overnight, nor did the degradation of customer service at Cadillac Ranch. Typically a signal needs to be sent throughout the organization so that even long after this incident, a line item exists showing a problem occurred and other line items are created to initiate a long-term solution. I suggest a refund of our $79.23 is the needed signal that will also give us reason to try your establishment again.",385265
2,"Dined here last Friday night (10/24) with friends for a 40th birthday party.  Table for 10.  The food was 50/50, and priced accordingly but the service was all but non-existent.  Ordered items missed and/or served under or over cooked, no checking on drinks, and no quality checks.  Just like the Eiffel Tower restaurant in this hotel, this establishment goes in the \""poser\"" category - a place with the facade of a high-end food experience with the reality of an Applebees. \n\nI discussed the evening with the shift manager...she took the automatic 18% tip off of the bill then told us that we \""were only hurting the servers\"" (out of guilt, we tipped back about 10%).  So to sum up:\n\n- Mediocre food\n- Bad service\n- Management that makes YOU feel guilty for their shortcomings.\n\nWith so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I recommend giving this place a pass.  None of us will be back.",168606
2,"I have gotten mani pedis here before and they do a good job but I got acrylic for a wedding and although it looked nice when I left, they soon started to fall apart.

5,They have gluten free protein bars now! Horray!,239165
2,Overall I was unimpressed.   Nothing really that exciting here.   I am looking elsewhere.  \nFor those who are concerned about where their meat comes from you should be aware that their chicken is inexpensive but it is from Gold n Plump and Purdue.   I don't know where their beef is from.\nThe shop is nice but much smaller than I expected.  About half being a regular convenience store.   The meats are nicely displayed and they are well staffed.,11520

1,"Ug.  First of all - whose idea was it to put all the rental agencies 200 miles from the airport???  Secondly, how is it that Hertz had a line an hour long while all the other car rental agencies had no one in line???  Something is seriously messed up here.  Once I finally got my keys, the parking lot number the car was supposed to be parked in didn't exist which led to the fun \""find the rental car\"" game because there was zero staff in the garage to help.\n\nOn the way back to the airport, it took us forever to find the car drop-off location because the signage sucked so bad.  The actual process of dropping of the car wasn't bad but then you had to wait for a bus and drive 200 miles back to the airport.",90846
4,"Being from New Orleans I'm never ever impressed with \""cajun/creole\"" resturants outside of Louisiana. Going in my expectations were very low and I expected bland commercial cuisine. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. The flavors were well developed. It wasnt just bland heavily spicy food. It has nothing on resturants in New Orleans. But generally places outside of the Boot don't. But I'd recommend it to a friend.",78829

The front desk lady said that all the high floor rooms were taken by the convention that was in town. She said she had a room on the 8th fl. I said that wouldn't do so she found, lol, 2 rooms on the 15th floor. The room looked at the convention center roof. They have 56 floors so you know where we were. She also told me that for what I was paying that was a good room. They sent me a special room rate. Why do they send it if you shouldn't use it. The floors are dirty and the bathtub/shower is stupid. Stay at The Cosmo or Vdara.",375168
5,"5 stars isnt enough for this place...... literally the BEST sushi i have EVER had..... they have so many different types of rolls and well a great selection of hand rolls.  i eat here about twice a week (which is not enough, if u ask me!!!).  the fish is so fresh, the flavors are amazing, and the atmosphere is fun too!  The staff are all friendly.  As soon as you walk in, the entire staff greets you. \n\n Some of my favorite rolls include the screaming orgasm, spring mountain roll, almost 90%, and the lisa hand roll.  Just writing this review makes me want to go have some now!!!!!",60119
2,"This restaurant was decently rated, but my experience didn't live up to the high rating. Our waiter seemed very rushed & very inattentive. He never came to refill our water, it took a long time to even find him to get the bill. Interestingly the only thing he was doing was taking orders. Other people brought the drinks, brought out the food, & cleaned up. I thought he'd be more accessible with so little to do. \n\nThe chicken I ordered was dry, & the sauce was very overpowering. I never tasted the chicken, only felt the over cooked texture. My friend's pasta was better than my chicken, & cost half as much. Granted it was busy, but the service lacked, as did the food. \n\nThe bright spot was the homemade ice cream. It was as advertised, but not enough to make up for the remainder of the dinner. \n\nWith so many options nearby in Edinburgh, including many Italian restaurants, I'd look around before settling on this place, unless you're just getting ice cream.",354277
5,"Love love love this place! Came here w my BFF. Found it on yelp. Service was fantastic. Above and beyond. Not only did they do a great mani pedi for my friends but they also gave me a VIP room w blanket, an awesome bed to rest in and TV while I was waiting. The manager  even offered to feed my fruit. Ha. Love love love this place. I woulda given it 10 stars if it was possible!!!",440330
3,"Good place to dine while in the Phoenix airport. The service is friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and the food is good. I ordered the grilled chicken stuffed pita with lettuce, tomato, hummus, and a vinaigrette. There are plugins too. Can't beat that.",506123
1,"Bland, blech, barf. \n\nThat's pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger. The food here is the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venturing into Lean Cuisine territory. I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!) \n\nI think I gave it a fair shake. I ate here a total of four times, with different people and different food. I was not impressed once. In fact, I was pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weaving itself through my molded mound of rice. \n\nNo spice. No life. No business from me.",13308
3,"I am not much of a meat eater, but I have to say that the meat is not that great. Too salty for my taste and the employees do not seem to understand the concept of their own \"" do no interrupt\"" signal. They bombard you with more and more. Almost all their meat is wrapped in bacon. This is rather annoying since I don't eat pig at all. Their salad bar is less than impressive. I rate it 3 stars due to the staff being friendly and helpful. \n\nIf you are a big meat eater, you will enjoy this place. Also, if you like meat with lots of salt.",347634
3,"Tried this place last week, ordering two pies for work. They were about a mile away and I had heard how great the new owners have made it. \n\nWhat can I say? It came quickly, arriving within 20-25 minutes. They don't charge a delivery fee, which is a bonus since I hate places that scam customers by charging that shit and not providing it to the driver... The pizza? Well, it was passable. Definitely not the best pizza, but far from the worst. \n\nWould I go there again? Perhaps. It's not up to Du\u00e9 Pizzeria's level, but sometimes I just don't feel like driving to the strip for pizza... and since Rebels Pizza has closed, this place would be a decent second choice.",403900

2,"Here's the grade detail -\n\nFood - Minus 2 stars. We had the scallop appetizer and it was great. The chicken was BOILED, and then browned  very briefly on the grill. THe shrimp fried rice was meh, although the veggie fried rice was pretty good (they were about a 1/3 cup serving each). The maitake with truffle butter was absolutely delicious (about 5 mushrooms), the steak was just ok. The bok choy was very VERY good. The portions were miniscule. The fingerlng potatoes were literally TWO potatoes, halved. For desert we had a flavored creme brulee, or at least they called it creme brulee. I like my creme brulee to have a crisp candy coating, and whatever flavor you add should not turn the custard consistency to that of coffee grounds, but according to them, it was creme brulee and who am I to argue?\n\nPrice - Minus 2 stars. $10 for the two fingerling potatos. $30 for the boiled chicken. And $20 PER OUNCE for the steak. Don't make me do math!!!! just price the damn thing $80 or $100 and be done with it.. Making me decide how many ounces to pay for (and watching you weigh it out!!!!) is just nickle and diming me. It just feels petty. \n\nHow about a prix fixe menu? Since you've only got a few things to choose from anyway?\n\nStaff - Plus 1 star. They were really nice and friendly and helpful. And you're not giving them much to work with, so I really hope you pay them well.\n\nBoiled chicken, FFS. Ugh. I feel like deducting another star just from the thought of it. But I won't.\n\nThe bottom line, $400 with tip. And I had to eat dinner again a couple of hours later.",567742
1,"Extremely long wait times in the drive through, with cement blockers so you can't drive away, smart for them, frustrating for the 10-15 minute wait in line behind people. Then you get your food, Warm at best, poor quality, and for me usually wrong with mayo on it that I asked not to be. \nInside of the restaurant you are called out by number, when they first opened it was a number an a rhyme, 109 your order looks Devine, things like that. That has ceased, and you have mediocre food waiting for you at the counter, that also takes a while to get to you. \nThey're attached to a long johns silvers which to me, gets the same rating, dry, bad food.",554161
4,"From the moment we arrived every last staff ember treated like royalty with a homey twist. When we made the reservation, we put in a note that we had a gluten free person in our party. And every staffer watched out for us. Turns out that most of the menu was naturally gluten free.\n\nWe started with heirloom tomatoes, micro basil, balsamic and a perfectly delicious cheese that melted in our mouths.\n\nWe split the bone in rib eye medium rare for our main course. We also split fire roasted asparagus and the best fries I've eaten outside of my own. Everything was absolutely fabulous and worth every dime.\n\nThe dessert menu was lengthy, and when we were informed that they make all the ice creams, sorbets and sherbets fresh the only question was what flavor. We finally settled on sharing a serving of Strawberry Hibiscus Sherbet which was topped with a little flavored sugar-I think it was hibiscus. A great ending to our yummy meal. \n\nI had a Shirley Temple with dinner. The cherries were dark red. Another supper tasty detail. And that's were these Heritage Steak sets a pretty high bar. I enjoyed my meal here more than The meal I ate at  Ruth Chris New York. \n\nWe very much enjoyed the design and open kitchen concept. The decaf coffee was the only thing that wasn't perfect, and it was so out of character compared to everything else that I had to drop off a half star-I give 4.5 stars.",616479
1,By far worst hotel I've ever stayed at .... front desk lady cristina is rude unprofessional and not knowledgeable at all!!!!,603766

5,Still love the South Point. Still earns all five stars. But they did away with the Cowboy Omelette! Noooooooooo........\n\nOh well. Still many good items on the menu. There's a South of the Border Omelette I got in June 2013 instead. It's not the same but will have to do.  [sigh],366918
2,"I came in here on a Saturday morning a little after 9am.  The gentleman who was working on my pedi started clipping my nails with a cuticle nipper.  I thought it was really odd, I've never seen anyone use cuticle nippers to clip nails, especially for my nails, which were long overdue for a pedi.  Anyway, I wished he trimmed down the nails some more (I should have said something).  As he was clipping my big toes with this nipper, it hurt so bad I started saying, \""ouch!\"" but he ignored my whining and went on to clipping.  Later, he went on to scrub the bottoms of my feet, and that, itself was not good because he did it so lightly that it was the uncomfortable ticklish feeling.  The nail painting itself was good though, and I was out of there in about 40 minutes, including drying time.\n\nI should add, when I walked in, there was another woman who already had her pedi started.  I was already done, and she was only halfway done.  So depending on who you get, you'll either get really fast service, or really slow service.  She commented on it to the man who was doing her nails, but disregarded what she had to say.  She also commented as the guy was scrubbing her feet, how that experience was, \""not a good one,\"" to say the least.\n\nThe only reason I stopped by here is because they open at 9am on Saturday.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",438984

3,"I love the idea of this place but my first experience wasn't great. I has the quinoa salad (yum) with a side of kale slaw (too much vinegar). It was so loud I could hardly hear my lunch companion but what annoyed me the most was being charged $4 for a drink. Yes, it's a large cup but c'mon.... $4 for iced tea?

Definitely gave a great recommendation - I went with the #9 Italian Night Club w/ hot peppers.  Good amount of meat, and other condiments.  Peppers gave it a nice little kick, even picked up a bag of their Jalapeno Potato Chips.  My only complaint is I wish the sandwich was a little bigger, it was gone, but I wanted to keep eating because it was so good.   \n\nFed a family of 4 for about $20, which isn't too bad.   Music was playing, but I didn't think it was too loud.  Sandwiches were finished about the same time we paid, so not a lot of waiting required.\n\nSorry Mr. Goodcents, but I may have just found a new sub shop.",567619
1,Just an update to my previous review.  Here's a suggestion to the management:  Why are you charging someone twice for utilities when they move out?  When someone gives their sixty day notice just combine the charges for those final two months in just one bill instead of two separate billing statements.,399506
2,"This is a 2.5 star review.  They advertise as a fish and steakhouse.  Instead they should advertise as southern cooking.

My steak was good but we had a table of six people and only two were satisfied with their meal. One was mildly disappointed and three were bordering on pissed.",377101
4,"Okay, so I don't really have much to say about this place since I've only done the cafe/pastry service. But if that's just a taste of what the rest of restaurant is, then the restaurant is probably very very good.  Think buttery pastries that are always flaky and never greasy. My favorite is the smoked salmon croissant--creamy, just a bit salty, all encased in a wonderful flaky crust. Think fancy-ass Hot Pocket.\n\nA note about the drinks. DO NOT GET LEMONADE to go. EVER. I did that today, and it cost just a little less than my croissant. I was surprised to learn that my drink was 3.25, but then I went to their website and learned they do free lemonade refills. Which is great if you're eating in, but sucks if you're taking out.",85069
3,not bad. i like that you can order online and set up the time you want to pick up your food. i had the thai coconut curry and pot stickers. the food was good. obviously its not the most authentic but do you really expect authentic at a place like this? not really. all in all i'm a fan. i'll be back.,247583
2,"Wanted to like this, but no. For a bit of background, my husband is half Lebanese and we've eaten our fair share of Middle Eastern food of all stripes and varieties. For really good Middle Eastern food in that part of the city, try Fatoush. Little hole in the wall run by an Iraqi man (I think).\n\nAnyways, this place. Honestly the only reason it gets 2 stars is because hubby liked several of the dishes that I didn't try, like the kafta. First of all, when we ordered water to go with the meal, they brought us bottled water and then charged us for it. EVERY other restaurant I've ever been to in my life has either correctly assumed that I wanted a glass of water, or asked me to clarify whether I wanted bottled water or not. When the waitress turned up a few minutes later, we asked for glasses of water. After she conferred with someone in the back, we got glasses of lukewarm tap water- with no ice.\n\nAnd then, the food. Granted, at a Mediterranean buffet, I expect mostly Mediterranean food, but here even that was too much to ask. Of the four buffet tables full of food, maybe one and a half was food I would have considered Mediterranean, and even some of that was a stretch. Some of the dishes in the buffet included: lasagna (looked frozen), alfredo (gummy and bland), pasta with chicken (just strange), zucchini fries (obviously frozen), fried okra (?), spring rolls (frozen), orange Jell-o squares (huh?). The rice pilaf was too salty and had Jalapeno peppers in it(?). As for the actual Mediterranean food, the stuffed grape leaves were the best of the bunch. As I mentioned, hubby liked the kafta but it was a bit spicy for me. The hummus was bitter- too much tahini. The chicken schwarma tasted like someone tried to alter a recipe for chicken parmesan. Really, the best section overall was the salads. The tabbouleh was decent although it needed more salt to counteract all of the lemon juice. And one other salad had huge chunks of feta cheese in it- the feta was strong and flavorful.\n\nOverall, there is NO way I'd go back here, even with another Groupon.",559626
1,"This place is trash. The guy at the door called me fat (uhh what, 110 pounds is fat? LOL okay). Then the short ugly manager wouldn't listen to me when I complained. He also told my friend she could pee outside when she said she had to use the bathroom.  Yeahhh ... Don't recommend.",476342
3,"Curry in the Box is consistently decent. It's not spectacular, but it's predictable and tastes quite good. The renovations are nice, and the atmosphere has improved considerably. \n\nIn the past, I have gotten Panang Chicken, Roti, Volcano Chicken, Crab Rangoon, and Spring Rolls. All of them are tasty and flavored well, and remarkably reasonably priced. \n\nThe service is excellent; the people are friendly and the food is ready very quickly. It's a great place to go for a quick, cheap dinner.\n\nIn my opinion, Sa Bai Thong is the best Thai food in Madison, but Curry in the Box is a close second.",318801
5,"I do wish that I had come here more often. The food I had here was great (I remember trying some type of curried catfish). And sure enough, I wasn't prepared for the spiciness - I went for three stars.  Oh well. Right now at my current location I'd happily take a good, spicy dish again!",157604
5,"Great place! Obviously all the burgers are top notch. The Rehab burger is over a half pound of juicy deliciousness. You can also get a half size burger thst is still plenty big.  They cook the burgers the way you order them. Too many places ask how you want your burger cooked than completely ignore your choice. Plenty of non burger choices too, delicious salads, yummy sandwiches and wonderful pastas. Awesome milkshakes, fries, sweet potato tots and pig wings (just try it). Great drink specials and happy hour for the cocktail and beer drinkers. Last but not least is a friendly and knowledgeable staff eager to please. Run, don't walk over to Rehab today!",558765
3,"I liked the Gelato Spot, although its not the best gelato that I have had but its not that bad either. Also the nickname of 'the G spot' kinda grosses me out. The decor/design of the place is way cool, the staff seems to think they are to good to be serving others, but whatever. I recomend this place if you are in the area but not worth any kinda trek.",229262
1,"Just went in to grab a small pizza after a 12 hour work day. Ordered a Casablanca WITHOUT mushrooms. Girl behind the counter even repeated it to me.....when I picked it up they repeated again NO MUSHROOMS and even opened the box to look at it...get home, SURPRISE!!!! MUSHROOMS. Baked all into this pizza. Thanks for the fungus. Make sure you check your pizza before you leave.....",248451

4,"This place was really good! Located in the Quad, the portion sizes were huge and the food was really good.  Our server was also attentive and helpful.  The chicken of the chicken and waffles was delicious.  I can't go the full 5 only because I found the waffles to be a little bland.  I was a little envious of the giant pancake at the table next to us. Overall, a ton of food for the price, especially by Vegas standards, and a fun menu for a place that focuses mostly on breakfast.",427503
5,"Visiting from NY, we actually found this highly-rated restaurant on Yelp ... and we were certainly not disappointed! It's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. A real VIP treatment.  \nFor starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. Many of the others sounded great too.  Our daughter, who is at college here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  All fantastic! Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love to hear about it.  We will definitely be back!",989
2,"Sometimes I feel like my food life is a giant episode of the \""Twilight Zone.\""\n\nHow Burger Bar is ranked as high as it is is truly beyond me.  In fact, many Yelpers I respect and normally agree with love this place but man, I haven't felt this ripped off since I bought my HDDVD player. \n\nMaybe Im biased against these so-called \""gourmet burger\"" spots.  I mean, what makes a hamburger great is that its approachable by everyone, regardless of economics.  Perhaps thats why it has come to be synonymous with America...that it crosses boundaries.   Not here however, these burgers are decidedly expensive and in reality no better than anything you'd find at your favorite local burger joint.  \n\nJust because you use the word \""kobe\"" or \""danish blue cheese\"" doesn't mean you have the right to charge $20 bucks for a burger...but apparently here it does.  Another thing is one would think a gourmet burger place would have gourmet fries right?  Wrong...here the fries were so mediocre I was yearning for Chili's.......yep, thats right I said Chili's and now I must shower to wash the shame off my body.  \n\nI had Hubert's favorite burger which was composed of Buffalo, Bleu Cheese and sherry shallot reduction sauce.  It tasted ok, but the price...oh that price!  Would you spend 15 bucks for a gourmet hot dog?  You would tell me to jump off a bridge!  My mom had the sliders and reported them as being ok as well, but nothing special.\n\nService was average but not very friendly.  I mean I would have a smile if I was getting a 10 dollar tip for bringing out two hamburgers and a couple soda pops but who am I to judge?\n\nOne positive thing to note was Burger Bar did have a nice beer selection with some unique options at decent prices.  Its nice to be free from the normal yoke of beer oppression perpetrated by the casinos.\n\nI for one can pass on this place again but judging by the crowd there and the reviews on Yelp, most people disagree.....Twilight Zone I tells ya!!!!",155345
1,"I've given this place a try on 3 different occasions since it seems to get such great reviews.  The first time  I went, I ordered the tenderloin, medium cooked.  They overcooked the steak the first shot, so I sent it back.  The second shot was WAY undercooked, but I didn't send it back again.\n\nThe second time I went for lunch, I ordered the steak sandwich.  I ordered it medium, yet once again it was undercooked.  I didn't send it back because the people I was with kept on telling me how good a restaurant it was, and so I didn't send it back because I didn't want them to look bad..  So instead, I choked down my undercooked steak sandwich.\n\nThis last time I ordered the scallops.  They did not taste fresh at all.  Over $30 for 3 fishy tasting scallops????\n\nThis place has a stuffy atmosphere and horrible food.  I will never go back.",219432
2,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. Don't get me wrong, it has an awesome atmosphere.. but, it's way too snooty to be a sport's bar(which is what it claims to be.)The food was good, but not nearly as good as it should be considering what you're paying for it--yes, it's pricey (for what is essentially bar food.) Our server was just flat-out rude... We just never felt welcome in there.   It is however, a great place to watch a game (there's tv's at every booth)..Other than that though, not a place to write home about.",388897
1,Great looking restaurant.  We couldn't enjoy the atmosphere though since they crammed everyone in the restaurant into one tiny section.  I agree with the comment about the food being a joke.  Service wasn't great either - lots of employees around but few smiles or greetings.  Don't be fooled by the looks of this place if you want to have a nice dinner.,86089
4,"The arepas are very good and everything tasted so fresh.  Yes, it was kinda pricey, about $35 for two of us, but my eyes were too big for my stomach and I ordered two arepas when one was plenty.  I had the Reina Pepiada (chicken,  avocado,  mayo, cilantro) and ordered the Carne Asada but was too full to try.  Will give to my son.  My friend had the Garlic Shrimp (amazing!) and the Vegetarian and he was in Heaven!  We also had the chicharron and fried yuca, also delicious.",512825
2,"Service was fine - I sat at the bar.\nPartially this might be my mistake - i came here for late lunch.  I wasn't sure if I was into having an 8oz burger (ie the big bun) so I decided to go for the tiny buns (3 sliders per serve).\n\n2nd mistake - I ordered something other than a beef patty (pretty obvious this is a beef place).  I ordered the Ahi sliders.\n\nSo yes maybe other choices would have been better.  But for a place with burgers as main attraction as a burger?  The slider buns were very disappointing - cold and hard.  The Ahi had a spicy herb crust on the outside and tasted decent (nothing to rave about), the cucumber and slaw under the quartered piece of Ahi were actually in my opinion the highlight.  In fact I would have paid for that to be an Ahi cucumber salad much more happily.\n\nSweet potato fries I added were decent - but again not really memorable.\n\nThe redeeming thing?  The margarita I ordered was very nice.",490049
5,"This place is as good as it gets! Amazing selection, super helpful staff, and the prices on used books CAN NOT be beat. I used to shop at bookmans until I stumbled upon this place, the prices are 25-50% cheaper on used books. And if you don't find something you are looking for, the staff is always happy to help you find it or order it for you. I took a Children's Lit class a few semester back and I practically lived at this store on the weekends. They never let me down and I was always able to find what i needed, and on the flip side my son's book collection grew exponentially :)",207554
4,"FIrst experience there was great!  No reservation, but got us right in and the service was fantastic.

Ok he'll have this other beer on tap, NOPE don't have that either. wth? The handles are on the tap thingy. So they lady unscrews all the ones that are out. 4 out of 5 were out. wth? So my hubby got stuck with bud light. Then I order a hot chocolate. She walked around the corner still stirring it. Yuck tastes like chalky water. So I send that back and ask for a pineapple juice. They lady once again comes around the corner, this time licking her lips. Hands me my drink and says yeap that's good. My husband and I look at eachother. So I grab another straw and yep it's good but kind of hard to mess up pineapple juice. \n\nNow to the food, no untensils no condiments, had to ask for everything! \nSo I ordered a short stack of pancakes (2) with a side of ham. Pancakes were just ok, I can do bisquick better. Ham steak was cooked on the same grill as the regular steak so had a charbroiled steak taste. Yuck.\nMy husband ordered a chicken sandwich which came with curly fries. He truely believes the fries were frozen and the chicken sandwich too. He ate it but only because starvation kicked in. Which I would have went back to the BACKSTAGE DELI @ THE LUXOR_yum!\n\nSkip this place not worth the time or money. Hit a food court if you're that desperate.",133717

It is not fancy but has serveral nice touches and menu items.....it is less expensive and beats out the local south side  competition as well as the national chains.\nNow dinner.  The quality and care that goes into the food is remarkable...and the protions are huge!  The menu has a slight seafood bent to it which is nice because Pgh lacks good italian seafood.

The staff enjoys themselves which adds to the awesome club/lounge atmosphere.",615164
4,"I mainly went to see this show because Yelp! had 50%off prices, so for the $40 or so, how could I lose?  I was seated against the stage, which got a lil \""dicey\""...what with 125# athletes, YoYo's and 20' hoola-hoops whipping around.  I admire the stamina, strength and willingness of the performers to put on a great show, despite a couple boo-boo's.  The main issue are the cultural differences with the audience.  During the performance the performers begin sort of a chant-cadence with clapping hands...Now, I'm not Steve Martin in \""The Jerk\""...I can get my groov on...but they would keep changing it up and then frown at the audience for screwing up.  Very entertaining albeit a lil juvenile production...but fun!",283365

3,"I have very mixed views on Bartolotta... \n\nI don't like the restaurant itself, like most things Wynn touches, it's overdone and gaudy...lacking any semblance of taste, simplicity, tact and sophistication. \n\nI'm also not a fan of the overcomplicated corkage fee process...Not allowing wines on their wine list, and  basically hiking the price and try to make you think you're getting your money's worth because they chill your wine to your liking, etc. \n\nThe wine list is a joke... and displays a real audacity. It takes balls to charge $10 for a glass of $7 \""sparkling\"" wine(Zardetto Veneto)! Or $15 for a glass of house wine that's worth $18 a bottle(Abbazia di Novacello)...Their \""better\"" selections aren't really all that much better, $42 for a glass of $70 wine(Brigaldara Amarone della Valpolicella Classico DOCG)... But as usual, they get away with it because the majority of people are not familiar with wines. I'm not singling Bartolotta out on this, almost all restaurants and even wine bars, do it.\n\n I also think the whole gimmick of having people buy an entire fish is ridiculous. You're looking at $200 or more for a fish that was caught in some of Europe's dirtiest waters.... although they've made a lot of strides over the last decade...  \n\nAnd...I also wouldn't recommend the tasting menu, here or anywhere else...namely for the fact that when I go out to eat, I want a meal...and a tasting menu is... Well, it is exactly what it says it is....and it's not very pragmatic.\n\nSo why three stars you might ask? \n\nThe pasta dishes are really good...you can request an entree size portion at double the appetizer price. It's pricy, but given the quality of the ingredients, authenticity of the preparation, and the fact that you won't find these dishes at many other places...if at any, it town, I'd say it's worth it.  With appetizers, entrees and corkage fee, two people can have an excellent, fine dining(at least as far as the food is concerned) experience for around $150. Which isn't bad considering...\n\nThe insalata di piovra Ligure always consists of tender squid and the wine-vinegar-olive oil ratio is perfect... and the rabbit loin with artichoke hearts and balsamic vinegar is addictive.\n\nThe  lasagnette con ragu di crostacei and the spaghetti all'astice both use quality seafood...the flavors and textures are perfectly balanced.\n\nThe  maccheroni with the rag\u00f9 Toscano and the agnolotti al plin are also good choices. The Tuscan ragu is rich and flavorful...quality ingredients are used. While the agnolotti meat filling is perfectly flavored. Simple dishes like this require top quality ingredients, and Bartolotta definitely uses them. \n\nIt can seem hard to do, but... forget the pretension, the gaudiness, the faux-fistication, and savor a taste of Italy...",180784

3,"This was my third year attending Bite of Las Vegas. Is it just me or is Switchfoot the main headliner EVERY year? I was very excited to hear that Sara Bareillis was performing as she is one of my favorite artists. \n\nI agree with Heather, even though there were the same amount of booths as last year, there were noticeably less FOOD booths. I even noticed some booth's charging $6 for certain items, I thought all portions were to be between $1-$5. \n\nThe parking situation was HORRIBLE, I knew not to park in the Flamingo/Twain but I was still stuck in the rocky gravel. It would be fine if they had some kind of control of the aisles. Their were huge gaps between rows and cars that could have made parking a lot easier for many. My friend mistakenly went to the Flamingo lot and was told the only way out was to jump the curb, in a Honda Accord! That is unacceptable at an event where there is an entrance fee. They should have enough money from ticket sales to afford proper parking attendants. Less American Idol rejects, more parking attendants!\n\nThe food was really good and I definitely overindulged, I do like the layout of the event.

3,"My best friend has been raving about the $28 ounce of kobe from Cut and how great it was (his gf didn't let him eat it after she tried it) and so I've wanting to try Cut for a while.  I'm not a big fan of steak houses but thought Cut would be different.  For the record, I didn't order the $28 an ounce kobe, I did order a dry aged new york sirloin.  It was a big piece of meat and that's what it was.  It was dry, flavorless, and very average.  I just wasn't impressed.  The wasabi-yuzu sauce was a nice compliment for the steak since it gave it some flavor.   For appetizer, I had heirloom tomato salad which I again thought was very average.  The salad was $21 and the steak was $59 and I don't think it was worth it.  For that same price, I could have ate somewhere else and probably had a tasting menu of some sort.  There wasn't anything spectacular about the meal, it just felt like over priced steak and salad.  \n\nThe service was relatively good, they were attentive and courteous.  The decor was somewhat depressing.  Perhaps they were going for the dim lighting of a steakhouse which is fine but I felt it didn't go well with the chairs and tables.\n\nThere were three of us and the bill was $336.  We had some alcohol and also a souffle for dessert which was so so.  My best friend has said that he and I will go to Cut together next time I visit him.  I think I'll have to find another restaurant to try instead.",309057

Bertha's Cafe is definitely one of those little spots where you can count on getting a quality sandwich or pastry and wash it down with a fresh batch of watermelon lemonade.

Yes, indeed.\n\nOk, people... if you're going to a place named \""Mama Ricotta's,\"" you shouldn't be expecting it to be terribly authentic.  But it is much better than Olive Garden.  The food is horrible for you, but delicious.  On our first visit, I had the tortellini special, which really impressed me.  The little pastas were perfectly cheesy, and the meat sauce was amazing.  It actually had little chunks of steak in it instead of ground beef.  My mouth is watering as I write this review, honestly.\n\nThe only part of the experience that was less than ideal was the goat cheese appetizer.  It came highly recommended, and it was tasty, but it lacked tanginess.  I probably wouldn't have been as let down if my expectations had not been so high.\n\nMama Ricotta's is comfort.

Instead we were seated at a small table where the game we were there for was almost impossible to see.  Pretty much every request was answered with NO for the entire meal by the waitress.

2,"I had been to this theater many times in the past but after a recent trip I had to ask myself, what happened? Over priced tickets for movies that have been out for several months, I do not think so. I went there with my nephew to see one of those Disney kid flicks and could not believe they had a huge line being handled by only 2 people. \n\nHere it is over 100 degrees and me waiting in line. So I decide to go inside and buy tickets from the ticket kiosk. Big mistake!! The machine did not work correctly and told me that it could not complete the transaction. So after speaking to a clueless manager who acted like I was wasting her time by asking for her help,  she goes and prints out two tickets. So before we headed into the movie we stopped to get a drink at the concession stand. Guess what? \n\nAnother big line with only one or two people working. So after paying 4 dollars for a drink and $3.50 for a small popcorn that was old and stale ( requested fresh popcorn) I made a quick stop at the bathroom. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. It was dirty, with paper towels on the ground and toilets that would not flush. \n\nTo top it all off later that evening I found out that I had been charged 100 dollars for two tickets!! Turns out the ticket machine put through the charge but would not print my tickets. When I called the theater they said it happens all the time. \nThey offered no solution to the problem and I had to spend three hours on the phone with the bank to get the charges reversed. If you want to see a film, hit the local red box or blockbuster video and pick up snacks from the dollar store. Cost of movie and candy $10. Not paying $100.00 to see Star Trek, priceless.",232419
3,"I had only gone to Downtown Las Vegas once before which was a gaudy experience, so I am happy this time around it was different. New Years Day, 2am, finding my way to the jail to wait outside until 4am hoping my boys would get released. It was freezing, people everywhere, and just waiting. Happy friggin New Years.\n\nThis time around it was nice and warm, I went for my friend's wedding, and we stayed at the Fremont.\n\nHave you been wanting to go to the Phillipines? \nDo you enjoy cheesy-ness?\nHave you been craving some Dunkin Donuts?\n\nWell you have found the right place!

One gripe is that it's so far from the Strip but it was nice to get to check out Old School LV ya know?",121113
4,"I love finding a good hole in the wall restaurant.  The food was excellent and so was the service.  Complimentary garlic bread and two carafes of wine was a plus.  I had the chicken rio which I highly recommend.  \n\nOverall, a great fun experience.  Will definitely return when I'm back in Las Vegas, NV.",131392
1,"f this place! \n\nmy boyfriend and i walked in, looked at the menu and walked out.\n\nthey charge 3 dollars for a bowl of rice. wtf?\nthis place is more like korean bbq, not japanese. false advertisement!\n\nand the portions would have been really small, had i ordered them.....\ndont want to pay $40 for a snack for one person. sorry! dont like leaving places hungry.\n\nso thats why we left...\n\ni hope they close. prime retail space can be used for something else. rip off prices. get them out now.\n\ni guess they tried to differ themselves from all the other korean bbq places in lv. fakers.\n\nim mean, but i think its bad business. i really do.",402052
2,"Hidden due to construction, look hard to find location. Service could have been better, waitress needs to be more upbeat and cheerful.",515226
2,"I believe that \""Skanky\"" would be an accurate description.\n\nThis place is like a scene from the old Al Pacino film \""Cruising\"" - only not as nice. Dark, dirty, smokey, and just kinda gross.\n\nI went on a Wednesday night, where the special was \""drink free if you're in your underwear\"". I'd say about half of those so clad were older homeless guys and straight couples from the local trailer park (and one really really tall, built black guy in red lace panties). Now, I'm glad that these folks have a place to have fun, but it wasn't exactly the scene that I was hoping for.\n\nBecause of the \""dark and loud\"" factor, this is not a good place to meet or have conversations with anyone. Definitely not my thing.",145022
5,"Cover was a little over the top for two.\n\nService a little slow, only two servers on a Thursday and 4 on Friday.\n\n98% of the folks there were courteous, however there were a few jackballs taking pics of the ladies.  Staff was very responsive and made the douches erase them off their camera.",190608
3,"I have been twice now.  The first time was a Wednesday night with a friend of mine.  We met at 6pm and stayed for over 2 hours.  In that time I only saw 2 people come in to get take out.  The second time was Monday (a holiday) at 4:30pm.  I saw one person come in for dinner.  I don't know how they stay open!\n\nThat said they have been in business since 1983!!  That is amazing to me.  I have lived here for 12 years and never even noticed or heard of the restaurant on Southern, near Dobson Rd.\n\nI find the prices to be a great deal.  The kids meal is $4.50 and comes on a cute brightly colored fish plate.  It contained teriyaki chicken with rice, a chicken skewer, a gyoza (pot sticker), fresh grapes and edamame.  A drink was also included in the price.  The first drink he brought out for my three kids was a bottle of sunny delight.  The kids were thrilled but opened it and it tasted funny.  I checked the date and it was expired.  The owner was apologetic and brought out peach and pineapple drinks in a can.  The kids were happy with that as well.  They all ate amazingly well... very happy with the kids meal.\n\nI got the tofu teriyaki the first time and the tofu sukiyaki the second time.  Both were good.  Served on a tray with rice, miso soup, edamame and a salad with ginger dressing and 2 pieces of agadashi tofu.  The price is $9.  \n\nI am a fan of the iced green tea.",33527
5,I've been back twice since I wrote this review.  Same great food; same great music.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.,144976
3,"I'm not a dancer nor do I have aspirations to be one and it's for that reason I found myself here. A sister of a of the instructors was working on a new dance piece and for it she specifically need untrained dancers will to be fools in front of recording equipment. Of course I signed up. \n\nI can't speak to the classes here, but now that I know it's there I'd recommend checking them out. It's easy to find in Plaza Midwood tucked right next door to Yoga One. The whole space is clean and well organized space with studios spaces in various sizes. I had a blast participating in the artistic exercise in part because I found Open Door a welcoming and relaxed environment that I would want if I was a student.",351737
2,Don't believe that hype - its a sequel... Went there on a Saturday night got confused with Moon - went there last year with friends and loved it but is closed now :(. Great view beautiful high end decor..... However no dance floor the man walk way has DJ setup and is the dance floor with DJ setup off to the side so everyone dancing is in the way of servers trying to get drinks out to the balcony and bottle service areas and even employees that need to bring supplies to the bar have to go through the dance floor causing spilled drinks etc (Moon had a large traditional dedicated dance floor which was great) . DJ was erratic gong from hip hop the EDM to old school to God knows what. Whatever type of music you like there's a song you like you go to the dance floor (walkway where people are dancing) then next track will be something totally different and kill the vibe (Moon had more consistent DJs). Balcony is tiny (compared to Moon which has an awesome balcony). Drinks were pricey $16 for bottom shelf well drinks. Very little seating other than bottle service areas. Like alot of the clubs in the last several years this club only makes sense to me if you a planning to go VIP and get bottle service and socialize. I you have to dance I would go to a place with dance floor and hip hop or EDM DJ etc depending on your tastes and preferences. We should have went to 1 Oak from what I hear. I miss Moon please bring Moon back that was 5 Stars for me.,181573
2,"I was a person that used to go to Serendipity since it opened in 09 and to be honest it  has been going downhill.  There were many problems I had with my last experience there a while back.\n1.  Prices are ridiculously expensive for majority of the food and drinks I remember when the Deep Fried Oreos used to be 14 dollars and now it's 18 IF you are a total rewards member\n2.  The ice cream I received for the Black and White Sundae was old.  The waiter tried telling me that they get \""Fresh\"" ice cream every day, but I'm a local who used to be a regular and I KNOW for a FACT how the ice cream is supposed to be like.  I'm pretty sure most of you know that when you put your spoon through ice cream it should be smooth and creamy, there SHOULD NOT BE ANY ice crystals inside of the ice cream making it a bit hard and chunky.  I mean its sad that the Ice cream at McDonald's is a lot more fresh than this place gave me for their Black N White Sundae.  Not only that but the Strawberry was pretty lazy to me if they raised the prices.  The reason why it's called a black and white sundae isn't because chocolate and vanilla ice cream, they used to have the strawberries in tuxedos now it's just half dipped in chocolate and white chocolate. I was dissatisfied with this and this was the first time I ever had to RETURN AN ORDER OF ICE CREAM\n3.  The LV Burger was OK wasn't really worth the price to me at all.  If the price was lowered a bit it would have been a lot better.\n4.  The people gave us the grasshopper in exchange for the horrible Black N White Sundae and it wasn't that great it was mediocre at best.  It was OK, but not anything too phenomenal at all.\n\nI would recommend just going here once now just to say you've been here or get like a Frozen Hot Chocolate to go, but other than that you can find something better",383044
5,"At the suggestion of a friend, we tried this place last night (Friday night).  It was busy when we got there (about 6:15 pm) and were told that it would be about 25 minutes.  We were directed to go sit out by the fire pit if we wanted while we waited.  In about 15 minutes we were seated at a table outside on the patio.  Our server, Joe (\""hey-guy\"") was one of the best servers we've had in a long while!  He offered suggestions and we ended up with the NW Pub Burger with salad and blue cheese dressing and the Kobe Beef Burger with fries.  Both were awesome and the Pub Burger is to die for!!!  During our meal, Rene (a manager) came over to ask how we were doing.  We told him we were first-timers.  He told us to save room for dessert and during that discussion, told us we should try them all!  I told him that if they were on the house, we'd be happy to and he could come join us.  Long story short...he sent over the cherry bread pudding (on the house) and it was fabuous!  We will be regulars and can't wait to try some of the other options on the menu.  Everyone was friendly and we had a 5-star experience, top to bottom!",532216
5,"The food was great! I had the Blackened Salmon it was delicious very moist.\nI also had the Alpine Village soup I am a local,  and the soup was good but I didn't think it taste like Alpine Village, I love the Broads with the old Vegas look very nice touch as well as the live piano !! Defiantly recommend",536161
4,"Man, they need more of these all over the place.  When I lived in San Diego, the closest was about an hour and a half away.  Now that I live in San Jose, the closest is an hour and a half away!  Thank God my parents live in Las Vegas now.  Everytime I go to visit, I try and make a stop over here.  Their menu is like no other fast food joint.  It's kind of like Jack In The Box, but better.  And their drinks, wow, what a selection!  My favorite is this orange drink that tastes exactly like a 50/50 bar.  Now, that's good stuff!",72354
4,I am in love with the whimsical opulence in the decor. I adore visiting for this very reason! My husband and I visited during lunch and the menu is more reasonably priced. The burgers are outstanding and almost overwhelm you with the sheer size!,408794
