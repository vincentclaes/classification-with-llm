4,love the miso ramen. I ale for two orders of eggs because they are so delicious. my husband and I have been twice answer will definitely be back again soon. the restaurant is small but way worth the wait,600051
2,"This was our first time at Grape Street and we were with people that come here quite a bit.\n\nI like the restaurant itself, the chairs are REALLY comfortable.  There are three options of places to sit: at a table, at the bar or outside.\n\n-1 Star: it's CRAZY dark inside!  I had to use my phone light to read the menu (im in my 20's people, so my eyes are still good!)  Definitely not a place to take someone on your first date since you won't be able to check them out.\n\n-2 Star: our waiter was a \""close talker\"" and kinda freaked me out.  He was nice but for some reason I didn't really care for him.  He was super slow with everything.  At the end of dinner, we asked to split the bill and they said that they couldn't.  So we asked if we could give them two credit cards, and they said yes.  Why didn't they offer that option to us?\n\nAnother Con: they brought out two dishes and probably 3 minutes later brought out the other two.  Kinda weird that the two people just sat there until the other two people were served.  Not sure why they did that.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered the Mussels: New Zealand mussels saut\u00e9ed in either red or white wine sauce and baked with parmesan cheese.  Its on the app menu, but we ordered it for our main course.  We had it with the white sauce and it had very good flavor, just a little overcooked as they were chewy.  \n\nOur one friend ordered the Jumbo Cheese Ravioli: romano, mozzarella & ricotta cheese ravioli topped with a pink sauce.  This is what he orders there all the time and says its good!\n\nOur other friend ordered Angel Hair Primavera: vegetables with pine nuts & fresh herbs in either red or white sauce.  She ordered the red sauce and said it was good.\n\nI think for the four of us, four drinks the bill came to $85 and change.  Our friends had a coupon for 20% off that was given to them the last time they were at the restaurant.\n\nI think I will definitely go again.  More wine next time and maybe an appetizer!",70297
2,Had a few that were great and some just okay. Crab mix was better than most buffet style sushi. Did not refill sections very quickly. Be prepared to take your time with lunch. Okay service. Would return but not immediately.,137635
1,"I believe that \""Skanky\"" would be an accurate description.\n\nThis place is like a scene from the old Al Pacino film \""Cruising\"" - only not as nice. Dark, dirty, smokey, and just kinda gross.\n\nI went on a Wednesday night, where the special was \""drink free if you're in your underwear\"". I'd say about half of those so clad were older homeless guys and straight couples from the local trailer park (and one really really tall, built black guy in red lace panties). Now, I'm glad that these folks have a place to have fun, but it wasn't exactly the scene that I was hoping for.\n\nBecause of the \""dark and loud\"" factor, this is not a good place to meet or have conversations with anyone. Definitely not my thing.",145022
2,"I have very mixed views on Bartolotta... \n\nI don't like the restaurant itself, like most things Wynn touches, it's overdone and gaudy...lacking any semblance of taste, simplicity, tact and sophistication. \n\nI'm also not a fan of the overcomplicated corkage fee process...Not allowing wines on their wine list, and  basically hiking the price and try to make you think you're getting your money's worth because they chill your wine to your liking, etc. \n\nThe wine list is a joke... and displays a real audacity. It takes balls to charge $10 for a glass of $7 \""sparkling\"" wine(Zardetto Veneto)! Or $15 for a glass of house wine that's worth $18 a bottle(Abbazia di Novacello)...Their \""better\"" selections aren't really all that much better, $42 for a glass of $70 wine(Brigaldara Amarone della Valpolicella Classico DOCG)... But as usual, they get away with it because the majority of people are not familiar with wines. I'm not singling Bartolotta out on this, almost all restaurants and even wine bars, do it.\n\n I also think the whole gimmick of having people buy an entire fish is ridiculous. You're looking at $200 or more for a fish that was caught in some of Europe's dirtiest waters.... although they've made a lot of strides over the last decade...  \n\nAnd...I also wouldn't recommend the tasting menu, here or anywhere else...namely for the fact that when I go out to eat, I want a meal...and a tasting menu is... Well, it is exactly what it says it is....and it's not very pragmatic.\n\nSo why three stars you might ask? \n\nThe pasta dishes are really good...you can request an entree size portion at double the appetizer price. It's pricy, but given the quality of the ingredients, authenticity of the preparation, and the fact that you won't find these dishes at many other places...if at any, it town, I'd say it's worth it.  With appetizers, entrees and corkage fee, two people can have an excellent, fine dining(at least as far as the food is concerned) experience for around $150. Which isn't bad considering...\n\nThe insalata di piovra Ligure always consists of tender squid and the wine-vinegar-olive oil ratio is perfect... and the rabbit loin with artichoke hearts and balsamic vinegar is addictive.\n\nThe  lasagnette con ragu di crostacei and the spaghetti all'astice both use quality seafood...the flavors and textures are perfectly balanced.\n\nThe  maccheroni with the rag\u00f9 Toscano and the agnolotti al plin are also good choices. The Tuscan ragu is rich and flavorful...quality ingredients are used. While the agnolotti meat filling is perfectly flavored. Simple dishes like this require top quality ingredients, and Bartolotta definitely uses them. \n\nIt can seem hard to do, but... forget the pretension, the gaudiness, the faux-fistication, and savor a taste of Italy...",180784
0,"The vast chasm between the 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews of this place is very interesting... but my one and only experience with this place is ZERO stars. \nI ordered sushi for delivery, and it arrived quickly, but the order was made incorrectly-- didn't even come close to matching the menu description. No avocado, no green onion, AND no cucumber in the roll, and the wrong sauce. This was an expensive fancy roll with only 2 of the 5 listed things inside and a massive amount of rice to make it look big. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know, and the \""owner\"" (she insisted she was the owner) spent 11 minutes telling me \""that's just how we make it now\"" ... I explained that the roll was far from matching the menu description, didn't contain the full value of ingredients I had paid for, and that this situation needed to be fixed. She literally just kept saying \""that's how we make it now\"" and for a while tried the tactic of telling me that there WAS avocado on it, I just couldn't see it bc it was such a small slice.... yeah... there was not avocado anywhere in or on the roll. I repeatedly asked to speak to a manager or supervisor but she said she was the owner. So then I asked for her name and she straight-up refused to give me her name, numerous times. I finally realized I was arguing with an actual insane person, so I gave up. If you're ever thinking of ordering from here, just throw $15 into the trash instead.",284016

1,"Okay this was my second trip to Global --the first being 3 years ago and the last tonight. We were greeted by a uppity hostess ..who acted like we could not be seated or taken care of..I understand --we DID NOT have a reservation, but it was a Tuesday Night and it was 6 PM and No one was there....no one other than myself and the waiters. She did say she would try and I went to the restroom and came back out and she ..said..POSSIBLY we could sit at the bar...So we took it..a party of three...and we were happy to be there--it just sets the mood when the people that own the restaurant where YOU are going to spend YOUR MONEY and they act indifferent to you..\nWe started out with a bottle of BOOM BOOM Sirah..it was good. We ordered 3 appetizers...the Mediterranean Lamb, the Berkshire Pork Belly, and Butternut Squash  Soup.   Soup was good..Pork Belly can do no wrong..EVER and the Lamb...not quite good and way to tough and well done.\nWe then ordered the Sea Bass and the Open Raviolio. The Open Raviolio had way to much canned tomatoes, zucchini and wet veggies...not really there. The Sea Bass looked beautiful..the top 1/2 inch was edible the rest..was a tough gelatinous piece of sea carcass. NOT able to cut or eat. They did take it off the menu..\nThe waiter ( Chris) was very good ...he was the bright light of the restaurant...\nThe restaurant..was ALMOST GOOD..Not quite..not worth another trip back..Oh yea and it was very high priced for a Not Great place....",345018

The concession stands had lines that people were cutting in right in front of ushers, yet nothing was being done. Lines were also slow. Ushers also didn't seem to care if someone was sitting in the seat you paid for. I had someone in my seat and the usher just told me to find another seat. Won't return to watch this team next time I return to Vegas.",122997

0,"Just returned from SoCal Fish Taco Co.  Very disappointing.  Decor and design was interesting, server good, but that's where it all ended.  Don't think much was made from scratch.  Everything tasted canned, salsa, weak cocktail sauce (more like regular ketchup) beans, tortillas......EVERYTHING.  \n\nReally wanted to like this place.  No flavor/seasonings ... Boring.  Wish it was different.  Shrimp tacos and grouper tacos had no flavor at all.  Shrimp had watery/boiled texture.  Not worth it.  Missed opportunity for this company.",605626
1,"1/2 priced appetizers at happy hour. The food had no flavor, the food is actually worse than a Chevys. The ambiance reminded me of a Chevys. The portions, however, are really large.... Large and bland.",554907
1,"First things first, let's talk about the ONLY reason to (in my not so humble opinion) visit this restaurant...  Fried Chicken!  It's good.  No, It's really, really good.  If you need something tasty along with it, try the zucchini fries.  They're good, too and the dipping sauce is perfect.   \n\nAnd there ends my praise for the Fox.  Sadly, everything else I have tried on the menu has been bland, or just fallen short of my expectations.\n\nI've tried the catfish, the fried steak, the BLT, and several other things.  Everything tastes like they're out of seasoning.  After my last visit, I won't be back.  There's just too many other great options.  I would meet friends there if asked, and if so, I'd get the chicken.\n\nThe place is also pretty loud and the tables are crowded.  Service has never been an issue, the wait-staff is very nice.",542065
2,"Definitely competitively priced. Communication is not their strong point. I scheduled a move and called back a bunch of times, leaving unreturned messages to ensure it was scheduled and that they had received my signed contract. They were about 1.5hr late for the move (\""staffing issues\"") and I was somewhat turned off by the comment \""you don't have to tip us but if you do make sure you give it to us each, I don't trust __[another of the movers]__.\"" Mind you that person had clipped $10 bills to his shirt to show that he accepted gratuity \n\nThat being said, the move was very quick and relatively painless once they got to work. One of the movers, Rodney, definitely knew what he was doing and instructed the others on how to carry items properly. Luckily, he did the packing of the breakable items as well and was very careful to wrap items numerous times.\n\nThey bring their own moving blankets and I appreciated how they wrapped the couches and mattresses with saran wrap to prevent damage, it seemed to help.\n\nSo, other than the sketchiness as above, the move ended up going fine with minimal damage to the walls and items (definitely a plus). Would I go with them again? Yes, if I could ensure that they had a crew with at least a few people who had moved before",560237
4,"I love, love, love how the California casino/hotel caters to the Hawaiian community.  And Local and transplant Hawaiians reciprocate by visiting this hotel almost exclusively it seems!  Therefore, we always make it a point to visit this place when we are downtown. We stumbled upon this place at the mezzanine level of the casino and saw a long line forming out the door that just kept growing.  Of course  we had to try out the food here even though we ate not 2 hours  ago.\n\nI had the special: Ochoa zuke#1:  tea , rice, Teri chicken, spam, fishcake, Saba (mackerel) and assorted pickles... $9.99\n-nicely done and presented in bento box.  EVERYTHING was YUMMMMMMM...\n\n-ahi poke: fresh ahi tuna marinated in soy sauce, sugar, limu, green onions etc.. Generous portions and very fresh.\n\n-coffee was 50 cents and my hubby was shocked.\n\nThere really isn't an 'ambiance' here, it's basically a \""mom and pop\"" Hawaiian style cafe in a casino which for the California hotel, is quite suitable! \n\nCash only.",120345
2,"I love the idea of this place but my first experience wasn't great. I has the quinoa salad (yum) with a side of kale slaw (too much vinegar).

The Barros in Maricopa is 10x more comfortable. \n\nThe quality of the pizza was sub par. All the pizzas were slightly burned and covered in grease. Lastly there were flies buzzing about. When my friend pointed it out to the waitress she seemed very smug as she asked him, \""what should we do about it?\"" Put up some fly paper, clean the place out. Very unprofessional. Big dissapointed compared to the other locations around the valley.",253484
4,"This is a perfectly awesome sports bar.\n\nYou can go there for any big game for any sport, and they will have it on one of their many screens WITH SOUND!!  They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.\n\nI recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \""5-star\"" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.  Good food, done right.",9641

1,"It boggles my mind that MGM Grand can have such a rip off of a buffet and get away with it.  I guess having a giant casino and a lot of hungry clients walking out of Ka or just lots of gambling will do it.\n\nIt's not that the food is terrible; it's actually fairly decent, and there is a very large selection.  My concern here is why I'm spending $33 for corn dogs, fried chicken, and a do-it-yourself burrito section with dry beef and greasy beans.  You could get those items in a $10 lunch buffet these days.\n\nThat being said, it's not like they're completely devoid of decent food.  The day I went, there was a section where a chef will cut you a new york steak or a prime rib.  There was another section for king crab.  The issue here is that those items aren't anything special these days; The Mirage offers those as well for around $25.  Even worse is that the chefs were quite stingy with their meat, cutting me a small piece and telling me to come back later (presumably after stuffing myself with microwavable corn dog bites).\n\nIt seems to me that compared to more economical but quality buffets like the one at The Mirage, you're paying about $10 more for a larger selection at MGM Grand Buffet.  But the \""selection\"" we're talking about here is crap you could get from Hometown Buffet... hardly something I'd want to waste my time waiting in line for in Las Vegas.\n\nBottomline: If you're going to spend over thirty bucks for a buffet, go to the Bellagio or Wynn instead.  If you really must eat in MGM, go to one of their restaurants or even their food court with McDonald's.  Avoid the buffet.",204848

The restaurant itself was really nicely laid out and had plenty of space for groups from small to large. We were seated right away and our server let us know he'd be with us shortly.  \n\nAfter looking over the menu for a bit, we both decided on our picks. I opted for the Hickory burger with a side of the baked potato soup, which was the soup of the day special. The burger was cooked to the medium I ordered, and had two healthy sized slices of Canadian bacon on top of it. The shredded cheddar was the big winner for me on this burger. The portion sizes are huge here, so be prepared to eat a ton, or get a box!\n\nOur server was really nice and took the time to answer a couple questions we had about the menu since both the husband and I have food allergies.

0,"My first visit to Cadillac Ranch Las Vegas location was very disturbing. It revealed a culture of disrespect highlighted by inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. This culture of disrespect seemed to be fully reinforced by management who did not care to listen or address our immediate complaints.  Certainly such behaviors have a negative effect on Cadillac Ranch's profits and reputation, so I thought it worthwhile to address corporate management.\n\nEvidently, our bartender, Rachel (Bar3-t8), was not happy with the 10% tip we provided.  We were $1.50 short of 20% but we were not happy with her poor service.  She was belligerent loudly calling us \""Cheap ass mofos\"",  instructing security to \""get them out of here, they don't deserve to finish their drinks\"", and proclaiming, \""this is my bar, don't come back.\""  We sat their dumb founded that she would treat customers with such disrespect. We quietly left the bar area to seek the manager.\n\nOur group of four never imagined or has ever experienced such disrespect. After spending $25 as entrance fee, $25 for hookah, and $29.23 at the bar,  a total of $79.23, we wanted to let the manager know we felt we paid too much for  the insults. However, to make matters worse, we were informed by an assistant manager, that the manager \""was busy counting money\"" so we were to take his business card instead. Evidently, while he had time to count our $79.23, he did not have enough time to tend to our concerns.\n\nAs we make our complaints to Yelp, the BBB and the corporate office of Cadillac Ranch we are left wondering what sort of abuse we might have experienced if we left no tip. Are tips required even for unsatisfactory service? \n\nIt also begs the question, \""Is this behavior condoned by corporate management?\""  Or, \""Will we get some meaningful action from corporate?\"" I know from running my own business and having worked at a Fortune 500 company that substantive changes do not happen overnight, nor did the degradation of customer service at Cadillac Ranch. Typically a signal needs to be sent throughout the organization so that even long after this incident, a line item exists showing a problem occurred and other line items are created to initiate a long-term solution. I suggest a refund of our $79.23 is the needed signal that will also give us reason to try your establishment again.",385265

2,"This was my third year attending Bite of Las Vegas. Is it just me or is Switchfoot the main headliner EVERY year? I was very excited to hear that Sara Bareillis was performing as she is one of my favorite artists. \n\nI agree with Heather, even though there were the same amount of booths as last year, there were noticeably less FOOD booths. I even noticed some booth's charging $6 for certain items, I thought all portions were to be between $1-$5. \n\nThe parking situation was HORRIBLE, I knew not to park in the Flamingo/Twain but I was still stuck in the rocky gravel. It would be fine if they had some kind of control of the aisles. Their were huge gaps between rows and cars that could have made parking a lot easier for many. My friend mistakenly went to the Flamingo lot and was told the only way out was to jump the curb, in a Honda Accord! That is unacceptable at an event where there is an entrance fee.

3,Outside this place looked like any other chain restaurant.   Inside a very very pleasant surprise.  It was amazingly beautiful.  Service was great.  They kept refilling my water.  I also ordered this chicken with broccoli and it was delicious.  They gave me so much broccoli I loved it.   \n\nAnyhowz I would definitely recommend this place to anybody.  Great chain restaurant if it is one.,34758
1,"I would have to say that my husband and I didn't enjoy our experience here, we ordered two po boy sandwiches and two fountain drinks and the total bill was almost $30.00, for that price we could've had a sit down dinner and not fast food creole. As we ate, the server's children ran rampant through the restaurant, and there was discussion about whether she or her mother were going to be working or taking care of the children the following day. Then my husband walked up to the counter to get me a to go container and while he was talking to her, she answers her cell phone and practically ignores him. Terrible service and atmosphere, the po boys were actually good but not worth $10-13 a piece. We thought they had made a mistake on our bill when we saw it was $27.00, that's pricey for fast food sandwiches!",364027
4,"During a extended layover at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, I searched for the closest vegan hot spot. I saw that Green had many outstanding reviews. So I headed over in a cab.\n\nAfter chatting with the staff, I ordered a black jack pita. Which is a blackened cajun mock chicken with artichoke hearts, lettuce, tomato and our lemon-tahini sauce in a toasted pita. And it was far better than anything I could have hoped to order at an airport. So it was well worth the trip.",111784
2,"Located next to Amos' Southend, this bar is a nice little retreat if you're looking to get out of Amos' for a bit.\n\nI was at Amos' for a concert one night & was tired of the opening act. So my friend & I headed over to the Gin Mill to check the scores of the game before the main act came on stage. From the moment we walked in, you could tell this place was a sports bar. This probably had to due with the fact that they are a Notre Dame friendly bar, & the Irish were playing, but it still was a very lively atmosphere. With plenty of tvs throughout the place, there wasn't a bad seat in the house to catch the game. I'm not sure if it's always as crazy when the Irish aren't playing, but it was great when they were.\n\nWhile it was a short trip to the Gin Mill, I think it's a great little bar to check out if you're at Amos' and tired of that scene. You can pop into the Gin Mill pretty quickly & grab a drink. And if the Irish are playing, look out.",80466
1,"the ugly stepchild of Binkleys.  I'm a huge fan of Binkleys, but they should have just stopped at that.  The fries are amazing, but I don't spend that kind of money to go eat french fries.  The sole barely had enough meat to justify serving anything on the plate.  Moreover, that minimalist portion of sole was overcooked.  Our waiter was irritating and trying way too hard but still didn't quite get his role.  I'd go back, but certainly not anytime soon.  I'd rather save my money and go to Binkleys.",324387
2,"It's not a mega resort but it's a good deal for the money.  I was here for a week long \""convention\"" of sorts.  It was really a crazy and wild party that has taken me so long to recover from that I'm behind on my reviews :o)\n\nThe rooms are a good size but there is nothing interesting about them.  The showers were OK but mine had a terrible drip that kept me up the first night and I had to have it fixed the following day.  The maid service was good and consistent.  They have a lot of problems with their room keys becoming demagnetized and I heard several people complaining about this.  It happened to me when I was coming back at 6:00am in the morning with blisters on my feet...so I wasn't happy about walking all the way back the front desk for a new key.\n\nThe pool area is nice but slippery.  I fell once and it was very embarrassing but then I saw several other people slip and fall too.  Yikes that seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen.\n\nThey have three restaurants on the premises and they are pretty good.  The casino is not that big but it has everything you could want.

It is a pricey upscale casual restaurant - I think we walked out after all was said and done at well over 100 a piece, but it was worth it for the one-time experience.  The dining room was open and decorated to look like an outdoor patio of an Italian villa.  Service was excellent.  I was surprised how down home the cooking was... especially the sides - we had scalloped potatoes and green beans - both southern style.  The potatoes were out of this world, and we joked if we ever went back we would just order sides.  I had the lobster and scallops and my bf had steak - they were both good but we both said after wards that we felt like we had had better.  I don't know, I guess for the price we both expected to have our socks blown off, but that wasn't the case at least with the entrees.  I don't think I will go back because we left with that feeling.  That being said, I have heard nothing but rave reviews of Noble's so maybe it was just our experience...",82845

The Meatballs were great and the pasta was cooked al dente, which is the right way to cook pasta....they get bonus points with me for that.\n\nService the night we were there was a bit spotty.

My only explanation for the lack of good service would be that it must be a cultural one. The staff is pretty professional - but i never saw one smile. And when i would ask for a substitution, it was met with much resistance. Then, when ordering desert, i was in a hurry and wanted my ice cream to go, they said they wouldn't - i was like \""put it in a dixie cup!\"" But i do have to say - the atmosphere is amazing and the food is great - i just think the entire staff needs to go through an american customer service training - ASAP!",369194
0,"Wow. Terrible service last night.  We were seated at our table for 40 minutes without a single glass of water. We had finally gotten our drinks 30 minutes in. The two plates of bread they brought out for the table of 15 were long gone and we hadn't ordered any food yet so we asked for the manager.  His rude and defensive response has to be one of the worst I've ever witnessed.  My brother was so annoyed he asked the guy to walk away.  When the food arrived it was sub par.  It certainly wasn't as good as it used to be.  The Mac n cheese was dry and flavorless, our meatballs were bland, we got about half as many padron peppers as we used to.  My shrimp ceviche was served on a different plate then it used to be leaving my tortilla chips to sit in the juice and become soggy.  Thank goodness we had the best company and we were able to laugh and still enjoy the night.  I will not be back...ever",555432

3,"Due to the fact that I didn't feel like spending a ton of money and going to a packed restaurant on Valentines Day, my husband planned a romantic night in and decided to order from Giada's for the first time. (Thankfully, since I wouldn't have made it to see feb 15th if he cooked for us,lol).\n\nTo start, it may seem like a long wait but I was really impressed we only had to wait an hour and twenty minutes to get out food delivered. We're a good 4.5 miles away and I'm sure they were really busy, so points to them for that, and points for a really friendly delivery man! \n\nFood wise, it did arrive cold which wasn't great because one of the dishes was chicken Parm and the cheese was no longer bubbly and soft. As much as I have to take a point off for this, I really don't hold it against them. Since it was valentines day, I do imagine it must have sat  there ready for a bit before someone was actually able to get it out to us. I'm ok with it for that reason. We popped it in the oven and for the most part brought it back to life. \n\nOnce it was ready despite the fact that my chicken Parm wasn't up to it's potential, the food was pretty tasty, especially their sauce which had a mild kick and a nice bold flavor. In Italian cooking, the sauce can really make or break the dish, and their's definitely elevated these dishes. I honestly wish their was more,  but that's my only complaint there.\n\nOverall, I feel that Giada's has potential to be 5 stars in my book, but I'll have to reserve that until next time I order. If the food comes hot and bubbly next time, I'll gladly update the review, but for now, it's worth it to try. Their prices, in my opinion, are reasonable, and you get a lot for your money.",509217
2,"Very loud, and overwhelming environment.  Personally I found it rather stressful, I guess it depends on your tastes.  The food was reasonably priced and tasty.

3,"This review is based on happy hour and appetizers. \n\nI had never been to Lolita's before, but was there because of a Rock 'n Roll wine tasting event. After sampling the wine, my friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat. We entered the main dining area and were immediately seated. Our server, Aidin, approached us and recommended that we try their happy hour menu since we still had 30 minutes left. \n\nWhile we waited on our order we got chips, bean dip and salsa. I thought the salsa was ok, but the black bean dip and chips were great. We ended up ordering the Mini Tacos and Dynamite Beef Taquitos. The tacos were truly \""mini\"" but delicious! And we ordered a second plate. The taquitos were also really good and came with a few dipping sauces. \n\nHonestly, I am a little surprised to see how low the ratings are for Lolita's (I didn't look at them before I went.) Our waiter was great, the service was fast, and the atmosphere was fun. Overall the food was great and the happy hour pricing made it worthwhile.",469600

Just a note; we also have been buying furniture from a place that is going out of business (Furniture Marketplace on Westinghouse Blvd.).  How can we be recieving stellar service, from sales point to delivery, from a place that is going out of business, when this newly opened store who presumably is trying to build a book of clients can't deliver a furniture order until a month and a half after promised delivery?\n\nPass on this one...with all the great furniture shops in town and in west north carolina, why put up with this stuff?",528172
2,"I go by this place almost every week. Tonight was my first time stepping inside.\n\nThe layout confused me at first, I wanted to walk straight ahead after entering the doors. Then my friend waived me over to the left side where the menu was on the wall. The counter where you order is near that.\n\nI like the simplicity of the menu. Either pick a burger that they've created or make up your own burger with different options/toppings. What I did not really like was that the server at the counter did not know what \""gluten-free\"" meant. He had a very \""wtf??\"" look on him. He went in the back to talk with the cook, then came back and brought out the employee handbook. We then flipped through it to find their allergen section. \n\nHere's what I can remember from the handbook:\n* Angus burgers are okay when ordered without the bun and without \""fried toppings\"" like the haystack onions\n* You might have issues with cross-contamination as everything is cooked on the same grill\n* Fries are not okay and there's obvious cross-contamination in the fryer\n* Premium and malt milkshakes are not okay (obvious reasons)\n\nWe were in a dangerous mood, so we stayed and ordered. My gluten-free friend ordered a Sin City burger, sans onions, sans bun. I got the \""Rebel Special\"" all-American burger, sans bun. I also added an egg on top.\n\nThe burgers came out on a plate. I was expecting it to be wrapped in lettuce, so it would be more burger-like, but it was like an open-faced sandwich -- or rather, a hamburger steak with toppings. We were given forks and knives to eat it with. Should have taken a pic, but we were starving.\n\nMy \""burger\"" was decent. It had cheese, pickles, raw red onions, and some ketchup/mustard. The egg went really well with the burger. My only gripe was that the burger meat itself was a tad over-seasoned. Not sure how my friend's burger was, but he scarfed it down quick.\n\nThe cost for all this was about $20 (including drinks and a regular shake). Worth it? I don't know. But it was nice to have a \""gourmet\"" burger for once.",490529
1,Got a great deal via Hotel Tonight so it's off to Imperial Palace. From scanning review here I wasn't expecting much and my expectations were met. The place needs a refresh badly though they seem to try and keep it clean. It took 90 minutes to check in on Sunday afternoon. They were nice enough to pass out small bottles of water but I would have preferred adding more staff to get everyone checked in. The woman that checked me in was friendly and helpful but not very speedy. With the line as ugly as it was you'd think they'd try to keep the chit chat down. When I was done with my 90 minutes in purgatory I noticed the line was even longer than when I hit the door. I'm betting some folks were easily in for a 2 hour wait.\n\nThe room was okay with carpet needing replacement but the room was clean given the poor overall condition of the infrastructure. I'd stay here again if the rate was cheap enough but I wouldn't go out of my way to book a room here. You can't beat the overall value given the location on the strip and the normal cheap rates they've been putting out.,167027
4,My family and I ate here on 9/11/2014 for the first time. I will cut to the chase and just say this place is delicious.

The owners were nice and lets just say we will be back to eat here again. I will be bringing my own container to buy that wonderful dressing for home :),428044

After waiting 10 minutes someone casually dropped off 4 waters  but nothing else. At this point we had waited 15 minutes but still had no idea who our waiter was. We finally asked the lady in the front to be moved into another section and she quickly sat us somewhere else. After that we had to wait another 20 minutes for food and finally ate after what felt like forever. This was an awful experience and the manager came over and just apologized and walked away. He didn't say anything else, didn't ask us if we needed anything. It was  a very disappointing experience especially because we have eaten here many times before.

I go back about 5-6 minutes later assuming that the ice coffee is ready... But still nothing.  \n\nThis time I go to a different employee and ask him if it's normal to wait 15 minutes for a refill of coffee.  His response is a shrug of the shoulders and \""sorry\"".  \n\nFinally 10 minutes later as we are leaving, they start brewing the ice coffee.  \n\nPoor service.

1,The epitome of average\n\nAvoid the mall food please and go somewhere better like Grilled Ave or Tokyo House.

Seemed like undercooked beef fat,all gelatinous. heh heh,gross.\n-never got water refills and I was really thirsty...hubby got offered a soda refill in our last five minutes \n-no mac n cheese bar, french macaroons, mini candied/choc covered apples, or egg-cream-things that night\n\nHere's the pros,hope I don't miss any:\n+I love the individual pots of foods\n+there are automated wine stations, which I'm still not quite sure how to use, some kind of card was needed, which was never offered to me at any time...anyway, there are 8 bottles in there and you can get a full ($10), half($5), or quarter($2) pour of any of them\n+the water comes in big beautiful corked bottles and tastes really good\n+my fav foods: gnocchi with asiago cheese and lamb sauce!!!!, shrimp and grits, white clam pizza (I had 2), truffle potatoes gratin, mac n cheese, THE CHEESE PLATE, arugala salad, mango parfait, passion fruit fudge, fatass choc covered strawberries...so pretty much everything I grabbed was stellar\n+gorgeous scenery\n+Hubby put this at the top of his buffet list\n\nSo even after the given trouble the night before, this place did exceed my expectations.

Again, there are so many.\n\nWe decided upon Aiello's and called ahead to place our order.  You can eat there or take out.   We took it back to my place.  We're both musicians and we were planning on spending the afternoon jamming anyway.   Pizza and music--reminds me of my college days!  Paul had ordered from here before.  He suggested the \""White Pie\""  which is butter-garlic sauce and provolone cheese.  We got a 12-cut, 16oz pizza with tomatoes, spinach, and sausage on it.  I figured my husband could eat the leftovers for lunch.\n\nThe pizza was very good, but a little pricey here.  It was something like $25.00 for ours.  Oh and it's \""cash-only\"", but they do have an on-site ATM.  For your convenience!",77497
0,"I only gave them one star because it may look like I just didn't rate them if I left it at 0. WORST PLACE EVER!! I was told by a rude salesperson and an even more rude manager that I did not qualify for the 04 ford expedition I went to see before I was even given an opportunity to test drive. After leaving highly upset I stopped down the road at City Chevrolet where I was greeted by a courteous sales professional by the name of Avon Spann \""THE CHEVY MANN\"". Not only did he get me in a 2014 vehicle which I didn't qualify for as far as ford was concerned. But he treated me so well I don't want to buy cars from anyone or anywhere else. Even if you want a Ford still go see The CHEVY MANN @ City Chevrolet. He'll get you anything you ask for. My brother is working with him to buy a BMW that is in Tallahassee, FL",8646

3,"I can't believe I've never reviewed switch! Switch is pretty solid when it comes to food and service.  I've only eaten here for dinner once, but their lunch and happy hour are both very good. I work about a block away, so it's a great place to grab a bite, and they usually can get you in and out of there in an hour.  So far I have tried the black bean veggie burger and the Caprese sandwich, both are delicious! They have wedge and sweet potato fries which makes it really hard to choose, but after trying both I prefer the wedge fries which is surprising for me, but they're really that good!  Yesterday the table next to me ordered the mac n cheese, it looked fantastic! I'll be giving that a try soon.  The girls and I decided to splurge at lunch yesterday and ordered the red velvet cake.  I'm not a huge cake fan, but this was very moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. Another quick tip for switch... they take reservations, even for lunch!",279401
3,"I have been wanting to see \""O\"" FOREVER!!!!  My wish finally came true for my 30th birthday as a gift from the boyfriend.  :)\n\nThe stage is ridiculous.  The way it's constructed and the way it works are both mind-boggling.  \n\nThe entire show is gorgeous, and I even bought the soundtrack afterward.  During some Cirque shows, there is a lack of action around the main performance.  However, this is not the case here.  There might actually be too much side action!  I couldn't decide where to focus my eyes, and i was constantly scanning the stage for interesting characters and acrobatics/theatrics.\n\nThe only downside is that we came to the later show after a VERY filling (and wonderful) meal at Le Cirque, and midshow we were both drowsy.  I was having trouble staying awake, and the boyfriend was just about completely out.  So....I think both of us missed a great deal of the performance, which is upsetting, but was unavoidable.",181693
0,"I was in town for a national healthcare related conference hosted at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I had never been to Las Vegas before this, nor have I ever gambled. I flew in a day early and stayed at a Marriott in Henderson. I spent the next day hiking to the Hoover Dam and some nearby mountains.\n\nI had a rental car. For a first-timer, the Strip is a little daunting. After some maneuvering, I found Caesar's Palace. I didn't know they had free valet service and wouldn't you know it, the free parking garage is a loooong walk from the check-in desk. \n\nWhen I checked in I made a grave mistake that only someone who has never been to Vegas makes. I didn't tip the registration person before I checked in. This guaranteed me the worst room available at that time. I hadn't done enough homework on the nuances of Vegas. I would be paying for my initial error many times over again during my stay.\n\nI asked if there was a cart I could use to haul my week's worth of clothing and tradeshow materials to my room. I was curtly told that wasn't possible, but I could employ a staff member to do it for me. I declined. Even though it was going to be an ordeal to carry all of it through the floor of the casino, I could physically handle it. I was in the Roman Towers. It took three trips.\n\nAfter I checked in the room, I took a shower. The room itself was a nice size. I had a view of an interior courtyard rooftop. There was no door on the bathroom. There was a handset phone next to the toilet, more antiquated than quaint.\n\nA small TV screen was next to one of the sinks. The bath tub was large and in-charge. \n\nI went downstairs and signed up to get a player's club. I also signed in on FourSquare and was given a free buffet at Lagos as a special. \n\nI told them I had never gambled before and they took their time answering my questions. You can't buy chips with a credit card, but there are ATM machines all around that take plastic. You don't even need to know your pin number (you just pay a higher fee).\nI had set my limit at $100. When I withdrew it, I got a hundred dollar bill (instead of 20s). Next to the ATM is a machine which will turn your $100 bills into smaller denominations. \n\nI found a helpful young lady at the small concession stand near the parking lot elevator who gave me a map of the facility.\n\nI had dinner at the Noodle restaurant by the lobby elevator. The d\u00e9cor is a shocking white pattern with mirrors reflecting light into your eyeballs which still maybe adjusting from the dimness of the casino floor. They had massive fish tanks filled with thousands of goldfish.\n\nThe beer that says draft on the menu is not what we in America consider a draft. It was a weak beer in a bottle and draft was the brand. The noodle dish was okay, but average isn't what I want from Vegas dining, not at the price for my dinner.\n\nAll night I was roused through vigorous banging on the hotel wall at random times. Several thumps were hard enough to shake my bed. In the morning there was no cold water in the shower. Thankfully the bathtub had a hand-held shower extension and I could bathe there. That was the only morning that the shower's cold water didn't work.\n\nI discovered my room shared a wall with the servant's elevator and work room. That is what had made the noises the night before (and every night at random times during my entire stay).\n\nI ate each morning at Lagos and each time, it was excellent (except the last day). They have two lines. If you are a diamond or seven club member, there is no waiting. Otherwise, come at the wrong time, and the line looks like a crowd waiting for a Disney ride. I arrived early enough (8AM) each day that there was no line. Typically by the time I left, folks were accumulating, much more so on the weekend.\n\nThey had wonderful lox, capers and other delights. The waitstaff, almost to a fault, was exceedingly attentive. The only negative experience was when I asked to see if my friend had arrived before I did for our meal. I was told to look from the door but was discouraged from entering to see if he was indeed there.\n\nOn our last morning, the buffet had turned from being breakfast into being a 'brunch'. What that meant for us much greater cost and almost none of the good food we'd been enjoying all week. Lox were gone, and most of the regular breakfast items were either low or out. \n\nAnother friend of mine who arrived separately was incredulous that we didn't know the tip rule. He had the same level of room reserved as we did (same conference) and tipped the front desk $50 on check-in. He was given a palatial, presidential suite. \n\nYou can smoke in Vegas casinos. I don't mind second hand smoke, so it didn't bother me.\n\nThe TV doesn't get many channels other than Caesar/Las Vegas promos/Asian ones. The internet is woeful and expensive, but I didn't expect anything else. I brought my Sprint hotspot and was getting 4G almost everywhere.\n\nThe pool is nice, but randomly, private parties bar all but diamond/7 stars.",236454
4,"Great place! Obviously all the burgers are top notch. The Rehab burger is over a half pound of juicy deliciousness. You can also get a half size burger thst is still plenty big.  They cook the burgers the way you order them. Too many places ask how you want your burger cooked than completely ignore your choice. Plenty of non burger choices too, delicious salads, yummy sandwiches and wonderful pastas. Awesome milkshakes, fries, sweet potato tots and pig wings (just try it). Great drink specials and happy hour for the cocktail and beer drinkers. Last but not least is a friendly and knowledgeable staff eager to please. Run, don't walk over to Rehab today!",558765

Went in to play a few games and was promptly harassed by a, fat, greasy security guard who thought it would be amusing to try and walk away with my drivers license. I'm pretty sure The Excalibur is a vacuum cleaner that just sucks up all the assholes that picked on everyone in middle school and high school and gave them a job. Which is sad and ironic, because Dick's Last Resort, while having mediocre food and is one of the more entertaining eateries on the strip, is located in this shitty hotel and casino.",127698
1,"Food was excellent. Truffle mac & cheese = amazeballs. Dining in first class restaurants on a frequent basis, I was less than impressed with the attitude I was given when I arrived for our reservation. I was informed that due to the fact that we were a bit late for our reservation that they set a time limit as to when we needed to leave. This is absurd, especially for a group of us that spent over $1,000 on food alone...not including the alcohol. The vibe of the restaurant is trendy, and if I weren't trying to speak with my friends on the opposite side of the table, I wouldn't have been bothered by the extreme noise level. I typically do not complain about service at a restaurant, especially in Vegas, but I felt compelled to share my experience in hopes that they improve their blahzay client service. All in all, I was impressed by the food and overall vibe, however the hostesses need to check their attitude.",222939

2,"Oh, fuku burger. What a colorful and moody character you seem to be.\n\nAfter a night of shenanigans, the boy wanted a treat. Having spotted the illusive Fuku-truck on our way elsewhere, we hoped they'd still be there when we were done. Around 2 AM, they were, and had a big crowd of costumed fans gathering around. Descending upon the Bank of America parking lot, you can hear their music blasting; we arrived to a song about capping people and a chorus of gun-shots and the N-word. Kind of awkward, but whatever. It seems there's a lot of repeat customers or fans that hang around the truck, as there were people parked and hanging out by or in their cars for the entire duration we were there. \n\nThere was no sense of organization in the line, just a clusterf**k of people mobbing around the lone girl taking orders. We had several people attempt to get in front of us and others asking us where the line ended. Some people stood on the periphery of the cluster and waited for 10+ minutes in the cold in skimpy costumes before getting frustrated and leaving without anything.\n\nThe music was also so loud that it made ordering a challenge unless you got in the poor girl's face or yelled at her. She took our name and put our order in. When done a guy would scream out your name  from the window, vainly competing with the music. We watched him call for 4-5 people with visibly growing aggrivation. \n\nThe menu itself was pretty simple, though I know you can customize with eggs or extra patties. We opted for the Karai, or spicy burger, and an order of their garlic fries. We ate the fries on the drive home and had the burger once there. The fries seemed like they were from a box then heavily dosed with their garlic salt. I liked the sauces that came with them, but J thought they were too salty. The fries had decent crunch and heft- they weren't potato needles or massive steak fries.\n\nOnce we got to the burger, we were disappointed. The burger had flavor but was burnt on the outside and ultra-rare on the inside. Topped with a spicy mayo, another sauce, cucumber, avocado \""cream\"" and a couple of other toppings, it had an interesting combo of textures and flavors to compliment the meatiness, but not enough to save it from being mediocre. The burger may have been more redeemable if the experience/atmosphere of ordering it hadn't put us off. \n\nThe area around the truck was trashed with half eaten food and debris everywhere. Stickers and photos covered much of the windows and the only insights we had into the kitchen was the irritated guy sticking his head out and yelling at a \""mutha fuga'!\""to get back in the truck. \n\nThis is really an instance where the business philosophy shines at the forefront. Compare these fellows to the Slider truck; The boys there sing while cooking, happily greet their customers with enthusiasm & a fist bump, maintain a clean exterior and fairly consistent food preparation. I've had a mediocre slider and forgiven them because they were so pleasant to deal with. The food here has the potential for awesomeness but I just don't want to deal with a disorderly mob to get a burger. \n\nEDIT: Bumped a star for owner response :} It's always nice to see a business taking the time to respond to criticisms directly like that.",466081

1,"We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say, the best part was the complimentary valet parking!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm, thinking the restaurant would be packed, only to find it about a quarter full.  Did we go to the right place?  From what I had heard, I expected there to be a line out the door like there was both times we went to Chima for past Restaurant Weeks.  It's a nice looking place, very open yet cozy, and it has a great bar area.  The server, John, was great and took good care of us, so no complaints there.  It was the food that was lackluster, and for the money, I wish we had gone elsewhere.  The bread was fresh and a good start (2 kinds, and a spread with olives as well as an oil and balsamic vinaigrette to wet it down). The Fattouch salads were good, though I question the use of iceberg lettuce for presentation as it looked like a low end salad with some red peppers, olives and a nasty tomato thrown in.  My partner had a Flat Iron Steak which he ordered medium well and got medium rare.  The first few bites were good, but it toughened as it cooled, and he had some difficulty cutting it as well as the asian broccoli (which he gave up on).  Being a vegan, I wasn't sure I would find anything to eat, but i did see a Mushroom Bolognese pasta dish that I ended up ordering.  It had a great taste, but the homemade pasta was a bit al dente and stuck together.  More like the wide rice noodles in some asian dishes.  Still, I enjoyed mine.  No vegan desert option for me (fresh fruit option, please?), but my partner ordered the chocolate cake and said it was good but very rich.  It all seemed to disappear, though, so that says something!  Overall, a decent dining experience, if we were spending maybe $40-50 max, tip included.  $30 each plus 2 iced teas ($6.98) and tip came to just under $90.  At least I felt like I got my one's worth with the valet at $5 for a tip, it saved me $1 off parking myself and then walking a block!  Still, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  With all the great dining our city has, I think there are better choices for the money...Ilios Noche comes to mind for great atmosphere, service and menu selection at about $20-25 less, and then we could still catch a movie!",7016

I walk up again and the guy asked if I had received my food. I said no so he went and had them make it again. They did. I get back to my table and the food is wrong again. Then when I walk back up the girl tells me I asked for different hotdogs. I asked for what I ordered and what was on my receipt. No one apologized. I got frustrated and walked to the cashier and asked for my money back. I said I'd pay for the burger and fries my girlfriend ate but not the hotdogs. \n\nWhat made me mad was no manager took responsibility or tried to make it right.

Not paying attention, we ordered Margs on the rocks ... But later realized the marg on the happy hour menu was 'frozen' , NOT on the rocks. Hmm. Okay. So I guess I wasn't impressed with the fact that they are probably out of one of those slush pre-made machines. A good list of drinks though; just limited, VERY limoted on happy hour drinks. On to food; I had the Thai fish curry taco; a chicken and the duck taco. The duck stated that it had Brie cheese , but I was not able to prove that. I did like the taste of it but the fish was my favorite. Ordered the shoe string onions to go with and again, meh. To follow it up, they were out of all the desserts except two.

1,"I'm a vegetarian and normally prefer hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants, but I was in Montreal, so wanted to eat French. But I know French food is not generally vegetarian friendly, so searched for one that was and chose this one for that reason and because folks seem to love it. But I didn't. \n\nI started with a tomato salad, the only non-meat appetizer of any sort. It was pretty good, especially the herbs sprinkled throughout, but they served it on a small cutting board for some reason, which was just plain stupid. I had to try extra hard not to have it fall into my lap or get balsamic vinegar everywhere.\n\nThere were three vegetarian entrees -- a pasta, a vegetable plate, and a tomato tart. The tart sounded most interesting and French, so I ordered that. It took forever to come and when it did it looked like some poorly executed \""artisinal\"" pizza you'd get at a mall Italian restaurant trying to go uptown. It tasted better than that, but not by much. It wasn't a tart as I'd define one. It was a piece of poorly done crust, with some tomatoes and cheese, and a few greens, thrown on top, and probably put in the broiler for a minute.\n\nShortly before my tart came, the restaurant sat another couple right beside me with only about a foot separating our tables even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It made the rest of the night uncomfortable for me as a solo diner. I doubt the couple liked it either. When I finished my meal, I asked for my check, waited forever, read about 20 pages of a book without anyone paying any attention to me, and then had to flag someone down to ask again.\n\nThe music -- early Stones and T-Rex -- was the best part of the restaurant, which is pretty sad.",371131

Awful, the guy and the chick here had major attitude. They try to fix wrong with another wrong... The heck bro! So I had to stop it. No Polish walked out.. Still paid them 25 bucks they might need it to go back to school to be a nail tech or manicurist. Ouch! Bam!",59895
2,Jimmy john is one of my favorite place to grab but after tonight it went down hill. I ordered a vegetarian sandwich and took it home once I got home it had ham and what not. It was the worst sandwich I ever got!!!! I called and they said I'd have to go drive back to get the sandwich I wanted in the first place. This is dumb and very annoying.  So to warning to all customers check ur order before going home.,523972
4,I've been going to Helen and Michelle for years to do my eyebrows and they are the only people I trust in Las Vegas to do them. I live 20 mins away but will always make the journey to see them and I have never been unsatisfied. At 10 bucks you can't go wrong! Russell has done my pedis and he is the best. Henry and Helen have done my fills and acrylic sets and I've always been pleased with their work. I love this place and have no complaints!,442711
3,"Usually Vegas buffets are a gluttonous amount of mediocre food. The Buffet At Bellagio is not that. The food ranging from mussels, fresh carved turkey, pesto mash potatoes and bagel with lox will satisfy families and the hungover! Go now on an empty stomach and enjoy:)",178267
1,"If you've ever had good Mexican food then you DO NOT want to eat here. The food was mediocre at best. The only reason for the 2 stars is the service. The host and wait staff were very pleasant, but other than that the food was terrible. You are better off crossing the street to Smokehouse. We had dinner there the next day and it was fantastic. Skip this place and cross the street.",194429
3,"Very tasty sauce on the seafood.  Shrimp are huge and very sweet.  Fried catfish basket was tasty with sweet potato tater tots and the catfish was moist and lightly crisp.  Will give this place another try when crawfish are in season.  \n\nHappy Hour 2pm to 6pm: $10 Buckets of Beer and $7.99/lb Signature Boiled Crawfish and $9.99/lb Signature Boiled Shrimp and MORE.  During non-crawfish season, frozen crawfish is $6.99/lb during happy hour.\nOther discounts include  10% off with UNLV Student ID, but does not work during happy hour or for alcoholic beverages.  \n\nThis place is a good alternative when Hot N Juicy has a really long line, but this place needs more happy hour specials to draw customers.",522381
2,The hotel has great location at the middle of the strip with access to the monorail. Entrance was hard to find. Cafe waiting staff sucks. ghe Buffet was surprisingly good with great service staff.,129030

3,"Pretty Cool Company.\n\n1.  Care - If you call at the right time, Mike will answer the phone as well, and to speak to the owner that has so many years of experience is great.\n\n2.  Service - Had an issue with our ice machine at the office and they came out to check out what we had and made a proper solution.\n\n3.  Product - First class product.  People are happy and it is working perfectly. Other companies we used to help us before were not professionally up to speed on the CRAFT of the business.\n\n4.  Personally - I was so happy that I decided to use them for my personal home as well and have it fully checked out. I like the team and service so I will be using them again.\n\n5.  Urgent - I called them twice on a weekend after my first home check up.  One of the units was bypassed when they tested it, so it was running cool all night. They came in and fixed it immediately with a good attitude. Okay, mistake on their part, and yet they handled it quickly and immediately. It is all about how you handle mistakes. That is the key.  \n\n6.  Urgent again - Called them to the house again as I was having a party in four hours during the heat of the Summer at 109 degrees outside. I was cooking and using the ovens inside!  4 hours before the party, I was setting the temp down low to cool the house as we were going to have a ton of people. The temperature was not working and one air con unit was not coming on..... The house and I were getting HOT.  Why now and why on a weekend again!!!! They came in 1  hour, determined it was a faulty thermostat that I installed 10 years ago and replaced it with one of theirs. All was good. I was expecting the \""you need to replace your system\"" quote.  They also checked out other items before they left.\n\n7.  Price - You often get what you deserve.  I think that they are expensive as the product that install can be purchased on line or at stores for cheaper and all, however, when you have an emergency, they are there, they are ready, they have the parts and you pay the \""right\"" amount, not the lowest amount.  I am good with it.\n\nIf you need air conditioning experts, ice machines, these are the guys to call!",264075
2,"Overall: Come here for the crab legs, salad, shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp, the corn on the cob, free champagne and the tiramisu! Other than that, this buffet isn't anything special compared to the other ones. Wish they had better dessert selection (the ice cream are those machines from Souplantation, although they do have waffle cones). \n\nCompared to the other buffets, I feel like Bayside is on the lower end of the wow spectrum. I've eaten at Rio's buffet, Paris and the Spice Market, and I feel like all three of those were better than Bayside. The only reason we came here was because Mandalay Bay offered us $75 for us to spend on any of their dining facilities.  So for about $50 for four people, it was a pretty decent meal. \n\nThe price may be cheaper on regular days, but Vegas is really spicing things up and taking advantage of the Christmas season. No longer are the buffets only expensive on Christmas DAY, but they've taken the whole Christmas week and jacked up the prices by about $10 to $20 dollars! Because of this, there weren't that many people the night we ate here. Granted we arrived at around 5:30 for dinner, but we were seated fairly quickly. \n\nThey have different dining areas, but my mom wanted a table of its own rather than sitting at a booth connected to two other tables. We got a very nice table close to the salad bar with a very nice elderly waiter. Throughout the night I felt very sorry for just giving him all my plates of uneaten food or food I just wanted to try because he had so much to do and so many other people to serve. \n\nAnyway, there's the salad bar (with lots of different toppings - turkey, corn, mushroom, etc and a plethora of dressing), the Italian station, sushi/breakfast/shrimp cocktail, Asian food, an Italian pasta station, a prime rib/turkey/chicken station, crab legs, dessert and a champagne/beer bar section. \n\nThe champagne and beer are included in the fee you pay. I was so excited going up and asking for a champagne, and they didn't even card me! Anyway, the food selection is pretty good but the food itself isn't so great. The ribs were icky and cold, the prime rib tasted fake (just like at the Victorian Cafe!) and the pasta wasn't too tasty either. \n\nThe best things there were the shrimp cocktail, the salad, the fried shrimp, and the hot crab legs (make sure you get big ones as people tend to take those right away), the hot corn on the cob and the tiramisu! Loveeddd the tiramisu out of all the other desserts. I think I ate four or five of those in the little small cups. Left a tip for the waiter and left on a slightly happy (because of the tiramisu) slightly disappointed mood.",218512
0,Ordered delivery Pizza was disgusting. Hot wings were disgusting. Price was outrageous in comparison to the quality. Cookie desert burn on the outside undercooked on the inside. Idiot driver placed ice cream over hot cookie so it was liquid by the time it got to us. Shouldn't have even delivered that desert.,59510
1,"This place is just \""ok\"" Yes, the punch card makes it pretty cheap. But, now I am regretting buying it. My son just doesn't play as long here as the other indoor places. I think because there is no \""toys\"" besides stuff to climb on.\n\n My biggest fault with this place is VIDEO GAMES. Why are they in a kids play place? The idea is to get the kids out of the house and active. My 2 yr old wants to just play games. I can stay at home and do that.\n\nMy advice,....get rid of the video games and put in some imaginative toys like maybe a play kitchen, doll house, tool bench, puzzles/book center etc.....\n\nAlso, all the snacks are JUNK except for maybe goldfish. But, the Plus is you can bring your own.",574338
2,"It was our first time to visiting ,it was cute decor . Love the patio , the soloist musician was great. The service was good. Our server advise us that our food was going to be 45 minutes wait. We were OK with that because we had time. So you are in a hurry don't go . We get our food we were not impress at all. I had the chili rellano dinner , they cover it with some red sauce it taste like ketchup. The guacamole had no favor at all. After spending $100 for 3 meals, 6 beers, and one appetizer we just where not impress at all. On our way out we hear a great band, now they do have a great band . We actually stay  a little bit more just to hear the band . so we decide if we want to listen to some great music we will go , but if we wanted to eat great mexican food we will go elsewhere.",99388

3,I have only had the bagels here but they are real good.  They definitely have a distinct taste that sets them apart from other bagel places.  To me these bagels taste a bit saltier then some other chain places which I enjoy.  It may just be in my head though lol.  The bagels run larger then most bagel shops.  The prices are excellent.  I need to eventually try some of their other breakfast options they look amazing.,317774

3,Worth it just for the view.\n\nWe only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)\n\nThe drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.,264892

I thought I'd bring the boys here since I wanted to try it and it wasn't as busy as some of the college hang-outs (e.g. The Nitty). The food was good and the servers were kind, but it was a little small and not a lot of variety on the menu. We all got burgers/sandwiches, and they were tasty, but nothing out of this world. I would head back soon for the bar, however, as they have great drink specials, and the staff was nice. Cool bar.",525681

He insisted that  i sign my application and turn it in without the blanks $ amounts filled in. I refuse to sign an application without knowing all the fees involved.  I asked numerous times to have a sit down with someone in the office to answer all my questions and i was told no. I would have to call the realtor on the phone for any answers.

2,"My favorite thing about this hot spot? The gelato bar! What buffet do you know that has all you can eat gelato with a good variety of flavors? This alone made my trip worth it! Not to mention the rest of the delish assortment of desserts! \n\nOne thing that you should be aware of is that the seafood buffet is only available on Fridays-Sundays for only 29.99. I unfortunately was not because I was ready to get my seafood fix during lunch on a Monday until they told us the reason why the lunch buffet was only $15 was because it's only on the weekends... Boohoo! Exactly why I took  a star off along with the next star because of their limited sushi bar that was not so great, which I wouldn't expect greatness at a buffet anyway, but they should have at least given more of a selection. The lamb shoulder however, was yum! \n\n$15 on weekdays for lunch, $22 for dinner... Same price for the weekends without seafood but with it's 29.99, which I think is a great price compared with the prices on the strip that's not as great... Belagio is still one of my faves!",378025
2,"On the corner of a dirty little strip mall, this little place blends in with the other various ethnic storefronts, but don't let that scare you- the food is worth the trip. \n\nThe decor of the place is not bad- nice tables and chairs with a little vase of fake flowers- no corny painting on the wall, and no pretense of trying to be someplace they aren't. It's a simple place, with simple food. \n\nI had the falafel, and my companion had the lamb. All entrees come with salad- which is really a plate of cut up veggies (cucumber, pickles, jalapeno, onion), cilantro, and yogurt sauce, pita bread, and soup. The soup tasted like lamb broth. Not my favorite. It wasn't bad with rice and cilantro added to it, but it wasn't that great either.\n\nThe falafel was really good- a little crunchier than I am used to, but the flavor was fantastic. The lamb was good too- i'm not a big fan of lamb, but this was really tasty. \n\nTraditional hot tea can be had for a mere fifty cents, but I advise you ask them not to sweeten it if you're a purist. They put quite a bit of sugar in it. \n\nAll in all, a good trip. Our bill topped out at an amazingly cheap $16 and change, and we had leftovers. Well worth it.",371347
3,"I expected the other people in my party to be raving about the eats and drinks we devoured. Apparently, however, our server was the most appetizing element of the entire evening, because that's all they talked about. \n\nI'll admit, even I took a second glance at the clean-shaven stud that took especially careful care of the ladies... and gents, in our group. Dude delivered the goods in style. But, gee, I must've been the only one who was thinking about the meat inside the folds of those tacos after we left. Seriously flavorful delights, folks. Dine on the swine, for sure, it simply knocks the other land-based meats, chicken and steak, out of the water. This goes for the domestic style corn wraps and the crunchy lettuce wraps, equally. Artistically rendered and inspired plates abound at the Mission. And I'll drop a big thumbs up for the kale salad, I thought it was fabulous; this admission surely wins me Metrosexual points, yes? \n\nFinally, the drinks. As a general rule, the further you wander from the familiar path, here, the better. While everyone was quite comforted by the house specialty margarita (and it was tasty), I found much more complexity and delight in the unusual options on the menu. Top it all off with a sitting on the lovely patio, and your Mission, should you choose to accept it, is impeccable.",356374
1,"Ok the whole point was to try some place new and we did. The booth was nice as we were able to watch the show on Fremont street. But the rest of the dinner was totally average.\nThe waiters seemed to have a little attitude. We waited 20 min before getting our drink order in and even then it was only cause we stopped the host to ask if we can order. We got asked about our meal when we were already done and had to ask twice for drink refills. He didn't seem friendly when we are a light hearted group.\nThe food was average. I got the tuna appetizer and it wasn't popping with flavor like ahi should be. The calamari the rest of the table got was like you can get anywhere, nothing special. For my main dish I got the crab stuffed shrimp, good not great. I like crab and shrimp so enjoyed but again the sauce and food wasn't popping with any flavor. The asparagus I could make at home. The sweet potato wedges were good but must have been a white sweet potato so not what I imagined and not sure I would have ordered. I don't tend to eat white potatoes. Lastly they brought cheesecake for the birthday, we aren't much into cheesecake but I'm told it was good. Now I love cobbler and have had some good ones based on my travels but their apple cobbler was bland to me. I don't know if it's the apples used or again the spices missing. \nI can say I have been there but doubt I would go again.",536155
1,Overcharged and overfilled.\nThey insisted that my car required synthetic oil which I found out after was not the case.  They overfilled my car with oil resulting in my car leaking oil in the garage for many days in a row.  I am going to the dealer next time.,147860

2,"My best friend has been raving about the $28 ounce of kobe from Cut and how great it was (his gf didn't let him eat it after she tried it) and so I've wanting to try Cut for a while.  I'm not a big fan of steak houses but thought Cut would be different.  For the record, I didn't order the $28 an ounce kobe, I did order a dry aged new york sirloin.  It was a big piece of meat and that's what it was.  It was dry, flavorless, and very average.  I just wasn't impressed.  The wasabi-yuzu sauce was a nice compliment for the steak since it gave it some flavor.   For appetizer, I had heirloom tomato salad which I again thought was very average.  The salad was $21 and the steak was $59 and I don't think it was worth it.  For that same price, I could have ate somewhere else and probably had a tasting menu of some sort.  There wasn't anything spectacular about the meal, it just felt like over priced steak and salad.  \n\nThe service was relatively good, they were attentive and courteous.  The decor was somewhat depressing.  Perhaps they were going for the dim lighting of a steakhouse which is fine but I felt it didn't go well with the chairs and tables.\n\nThere were three of us and the bill was $336.  We had some alcohol and also a souffle for dessert which was so so.  My best friend has said that he and I will go to Cut together next time I visit him.  I think I'll have to find another restaurant to try instead.",309057
2,"I've been to this place plenty of times before, & every time I've been here, I would definitely give 5 stars. I gave 3 stars because our server Scheila, was just completely horrible last night. I had an iced tea that didn't get offered to be refilled once. She kept refilling our waters but didn't ask at all if I wanted more iced tea. Of course I had to ask for it... I don't know if you pay by the glass for iced tea at this resturant but it would still be a little nice for her to ask. I don't think she even asked if we were doing ok the whole time we were sitting! The meat of course was beyond amazing. The lobster bisque is what I look forward to every time I'm headed here, if you haven't had it, you need to try it. It is one of the best soups I've ever had! Not exaggerating. We wanted more of the fried bananas and it felt like we had to hunt down our server for more. After all the food we had no idea where the waitress, so it was like an hour until we got our check. This is the first time we had a discount here, it was something like a buy one get one free coupon. Thank goodness we had that or else I would of been a little disappointed spending full price on the service we got. I'm thinking this whole bad service thing is because we were sitting in the corner, right next to her drink stand. But at the same time, you'd think she would come to the drink stand more often & see us. I'm not sure. I will definitely be back to this resturant because I love it so much, I will just remember not to ask for her.",347680
1,"Not a huge fan of this place but I have been here for lunch several times with co-workers. It works well for a large group since they can easily accommodate seating large parties due to the size of the restaurant and they have a very varied menu so everyone can find something that sounds good. The quality of the food is nothing impressive but I can't really say I have ever eaten anything there that was bad. Just average. We have always gotten good service, though, but if its my choice I would not eat here. \n\nThis place has always reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory. Very similar food and decor but I do think its a little better. I didn't know that they were owned by the same company until I read the reviews on Yelp but it totally makes sense.",291969
3,"I am far from expert in this field of  sushi but I've tried a fair amount at a fair number of places, and I thought this was exceptional. I already liked the Korean food at the predecessor C J B Korean establishment and now I have a new favorite place for sushi as well.  \n\nBlack suspended tile ceilings with dark concrete floors, walls of bright green and some modern oriental art in between. Slightly spare, clean, modern feel to the place.  Men's room was spotlessly clean, modern with up to date fixtures, stocked with all the necessities. \n\nOur young server was friendly and attentive and our water glasses never went dry - except when I bumblingly knocked mine over, which was taken in stride by staff, and quickly replaced with a fresh glass. Service, from being seated, to order taking, to delivery food, to delivery of the check, involved no undue delays.  In fact, as Norm R noted,  service was almost too efficient as servers were anxious to whisk away our plates almost before we cleared them, but I'll take that over that experienced by another reviewer any day.\n\nNow as to the FOOD, Excellent in every way.  Beautifully presented, multiple distinct flavors. Best shumai ever tasted. Tongue tantalizing tuna tataki, rich, red, flavorful, and our accidental order, the \""OhYa I Forgot\"", was a definite \""no regrets\"", the closest thing to a dessert sushi I've ever encountered with its touch of peach.  \n\nAnd finally, we didn't go away hungry, indeed as one should not from a $65 + tip meal for two, but you need not spend nearly so much.  There are considerably reduced happy hour prices and several \""chef's surprise\"" samplers at under $20. \n\nThe service we received was \""comfortable\"", perhaps more friendly than polished, and that's just fine by me.  I highly recommend with the hope the service you receive is as good as we got, and not the indifference experienced by another recent reviewer below.",234123
3,"I like coming down here on a Tuesday or Thursday night for a drink, late meal and karaoke. The food here is actually quite good - I've had their build it yourself burger (which was yummy and filling) and the chicken strips. Gotta say the chicken strips were less than impressive, but I did like the burger. The beer is good too, and they have good drink specials during karaoke. Thursday is ladies' night too, so having a vagina definitely helps there.\n\nSpeaking of karaoke - I love coming down here for Karate Karaoke. Ali Raccoon runs it on Tuesday and Big Sexy takes care of the ladies on Thursday, plus it's usually a pretty short queue.\n\nAll in all, if you want to relax and sing a bit come on down and check it out.",476071

2,"Seamless Club becomes a dance club at 4 am nightly, or rather, every early morning.  The area in front of the stage becomes a dance floor with the deejay spinning out house music.  It's not a huge space to dance in, but doable.  \n\nWith go-go dancers abound, you'll also have an eyeful of strippers ready to take you on for a private lap dance.  So, as you listen the pulsating beat, keep your eyes opened for boobs and ass everywhere.  There are A LOT of strippers here for your liking, so when you get tired of dancing, take a seat and have someone dance for you.\n\nIt's $20/pp for entry fee alone, free for local ladies and $10 for local guys.  There are passes available somewhere, I just haven't figured out where to get them yet.  (Taxis perhaps?)\n\nThe restrooms are an interesting twist with glass doors that fade dark when you turn the lock. (Just be sure you actually turn the lock completely, otherwise you'll have other patrons watching you pee.)\n\nThere's a huge parking lot with valet and all that costs some change.  You can try to be daring and park over at New Orleans across the way,   find street parking, or park in private lot nearby.  Just watch out for your car.

The attendant there said that they only play team games during the overnight kid parties.\n\nI have no interest in having a slumber party with a bunch 12 year olds just so I can play my favorite style of laser tag, that's just me.\n\nThe suits are alright, the course is compact but with lots of hidey places and mirrors to bounce off of, but like I said, the game just gets boring If you're just running around shooting.\n\nScrew the stupid tweens who walk behind you and keep shooting you after your suit gets active again.\n\nTranq darts might be a good thing to use - it's dark inside and no one'll see you knock the annoying kid out.",70504

Usually hot pot places aren't too thrilling or the greatest thing in the world to me, but after coming here it is life changing (or at least opinion changing). \n\nGuess what they had on their menu that caught my eyes... a mushroom party plate!! I cannot stress enough on how much I love mushrooms. I LOVE IT!! *does a little dance* This plate has 6 or 7 different types of mushrooms and a second plate full of vegetables with noodles.

4,"First and foremost, I'm not the biggest coffee drinker, usually a sucker for coffee beans & sugar -- mainly why my drink is a white chocolate mocha.  However, my girlfriend is a big-time coffee fanatic and a barista.  She moved to the valley of the sun months ago and immediately tried to find a place that reminded her of home.  I can admit that I had never been to Solo because I rarely ever drank coffee, let alone went to a coffee house to sit around while drinking it.  Times change I guess.  At any rate, enough of my rants.  We went to Solo Cafe six months ago for the first time and absolutely loved it.   Yes, FREE wi-fi, which is always a good idea if you're running a cafe, a easy going atmosphere, \""coffee-esque ambiance\"" with bookshelves, tables, books and games.  The latte is awesome and if you're a sucker for sweet drinks like I am, I do highly recommend the White Chocolate Mocha.  Friggin' awesome.  I'm a pastry (cherry) and mocha man now thanks to Solo.  Costs me about $5 total for both.  For the overall quality and professionalism, go check it out and Chad (owner) we'll be happy to make you a drink.",304132
1,"This restaurant was decently rated, but my experience didn't live up to the high rating. Our waiter seemed very rushed & very inattentive. He never came to refill our water, it took a long time to even find him to get the bill. Interestingly the only thing he was doing was taking orders. Other people brought the drinks, brought out the food, & cleaned up. I thought he'd be more accessible with so little to do. \n\nThe chicken I ordered was dry, & the sauce was very overpowering. I never tasted the chicken, only felt the over cooked texture. My friend's pasta was better than my chicken, & cost half as much. Granted it was busy, but the service lacked, as did the food. \n\nThe bright spot was the homemade ice cream. It was as advertised, but not enough to make up for the remainder of the dinner. \n\nWith so many options nearby in Edinburgh, including many Italian restaurants, I'd look around before settling on this place, unless you're just getting ice cream.",354277

3,"Ahhhhhhh....this was my first trip to Vegas that was not a blow-out girls trip. Instead, I tagged along with my poker-lovin' travelin' man (after assuring him I wouldn't cramp his table style), so I had a decent amount of time on my hands during the day. Cue spa day! \n\nI scheduled a 50 minute Ashiatsu massage because I can't seem to find anyone who does them in Atlanta and, if you really like deep tissue massage, there is truly nothing like it. The therapist massages you with his or her FEET! And no, they're not just walking on your back like my parents had me do when I was a kid, they are truly *massaging* you with those footsies, while holding on to bars bolted into the ceiling. I just can't describe it properly - it's freakin' amazing. \n\nI generally say \""no preference\"" when it comes to gender of the stranger who will be rubbin' away but had a mild moment of regret when my dude came to get me from the lounge - ewww boys' feet are YUCKY! Wow, I got over that real fast. This is going to come across wrong, but that man REALLY knew how to use his feet!\n\nThe massage was over before I knew it, as they do, but the noon poker tourney had just gotten started, so I took my time and took full advantage of every single amenity that spa had to offer. The women-only wet area is like most - hot jacuzzi, cold plunge pool, and a small \""warm\"" jacuzzi as well - as Goldilocks would say, it was juuuuust right. Eucalyptus steam room sweated Saturday night right out of me and the Redwood Sauna gave my skin a glow. Most ladies kept their swimsuits on, but a few free spirits went topless. The coed areas include the waiting lounge, a salt room, hot stone beds, and outdoor soaking pool overlooking the Liquid Lounge. Salt room was totally weird - Trekkie-esque lounge chairs and vibrating new age music. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting it to smell like the seaside, and instead it felt kind of cold and sterile, but stick around for a while - eventually you'll start to feel the effect of the salt cleaning out those sinuses. \n\nI'm not completely embarrassed to admit that my favorite part just might have been the sheer abundance of US Weekly and People magazines casually lying about in each room...oh yes, sometimes I just adore being a girl!",392901

I had raspberry mojitos and they were really good.  The DJ was really, really good on this particular Monday.  Not sure if it's the resident DJ or if it was a guest DJ.  Security was super friendly too.  The place closed promptly at 6pm.",238885
3,"Very late review... For reasons to be a bit clearer in a moment. Definitely a hipster vibe as others have pointed out YET more inclusive than a crappy Chicago dive bar any day of the week.\n\nI visited during a trip I made on Labor Day weekend, just to cash in some miles and get away from the above mentioned city and its 1/3 of a summer we experienced this year. Seriously, felt like spring never ended, no Indian summer and straight into snow this week. I digress. I was genuinely concerned I'd run into the local Yelpers for whom I've had a long standing feud (although I noticed certain arch members have dropped off the face of online Yelp terra) yet I soldiered on. My concerns were lifted when I noticed a) how crowded it was. b) how young the crowd was and c) it was noticeably a hip hop night with DJ to boot. As inclusive as they pretend to be I'd never imagine to see the Yelp crowd that I knew at an \""urban\"" music setting. This proved to be the busiest venue that weekend as Phoenix was, as usual, an utter ghost town and historically so on both Memorial and Labor Day weekends - hence, the perfect weekend for a visit. I wanted to concentrate on visiting my favorite spots of old.\n\nSo, to summarize: SideBar is still open, and not taken over by some corporate chain. It's still open late nights. It hasn't lost its good atmosphere, even though it was too crowded for me that night. I am happy the Phx is retaining some culture without the CenPho idiots inserting themselves into everything nor making a pointless cause out of a new bar or restaurant constantly.",361303

That's probably how they make their money because how do they make any when they turn customers away? \n\nAlso the only bathroom is a Mr. John port-a-potty.

4,"At the suggestion of a friend, we tried this place last night (Friday night).  It was busy when we got there (about 6:15 pm) and were told that it would be about 25 minutes.  We were directed to go sit out by the fire pit if we wanted while we waited.  In about 15 minutes we were seated at a table outside on the patio.  Our server, Joe (\""hey-guy\"") was one of the best servers we've had in a long while!  He offered suggestions and we ended up with the NW Pub Burger with salad and blue cheese dressing and the Kobe Beef Burger with fries.  Both were awesome and the Pub Burger is to die for!!!  During our meal, Rene (a manager) came over to ask how we were doing.  We told him we were first-timers.  He told us to save room for dessert and during that discussion, told us we should try them all!  I told him that if they were on the house, we'd be happy to and he could come join us.  Long story short...he sent over the cherry bread pudding (on the house) and it was fabuous!  We will be regulars and can't wait to try some of the other options on the menu.  Everyone was friendly and we had a 5-star experience, top to bottom!",532216
1,"Was told to go somewhere else by the owner.

Apparently he wanted us to shop around at all the other suit places so they could do all the work of having us try suits on and he could skip out on it. He wouldn't even allow us to try on a suit!!!  He said \""It just takes so much time with people coming in and trying suit after suit on\"". Man that poor guy owning a suit shop, who knew people would actually want to try them on? \n\nSo the customer service is non-existent unless you're willing to walk in and know exactly what you want right away.

Lots of miles, lots of memories. Sure it is just an inanimate object. But this thing is so close to have been in all fifty states. Yes, ALL fifty (including Hawai'i). \n\nI digress. \n\nSo it is on on off-ramp of the 215. Disabled. I might or might not have checked in to CR-215 right before she broke down (a BIG fuck you to all the 'checking-in to beltways and parks and landmarks is pointless' crowd). \n\nAnyway, driver shows up. Gets the nifty ramp on his truck lowered and directs me to take the emergency brake off. Well, I do as told but must say that I do not keep my shift in gear. There are people that do and people who don't. I don't. What is the point? I always use the emergency brake. Fuck off, stop judging me. \n\nSo the car rolls. Fast. We are trying to stop it. Not working. Car suddenly stops. \n\nI get inside and pull the brake again. Driver, Cameron (?), points at his leg which is caught from the above the ankle down underneath my back tire. Car stopped suddenly because he used his foot like one uses a door stop, except on a car not a door and he used flesh and not rubbermaid\u00ae. \n\nFucking aye. \n\nCameron, or whatever his westernized name was, is Iraqi-American. We talked the whole way to the mechanic shop. Hardcore, albeit very kind and thoughtful, dude. \n\n777 Towing was just who USAA called up for my roadside assistance. They showed up well before the ETA and have at least one driver who will keep you entertained as you are driven to the shop. \n\n'Cameron' probably did not even have his foot checked out.

4,"I  love this place. This is like a mini version of a Fresh and Easy Market Filipino style. It's a lifesaver if you realize you're out of something like a can of coconut milk or some dried fish or sweet rice flour which is one item I bought today.  Before you drive a half hour or so to Seafood City, come here instead. There is a little of everything you need to make your favorite Filipino dish.  My mom lives 2 miles away, and always sends me or my brother here to get this and that. For North Vegas residents, it's a stress free and rather fun drive.\n\nThis is a family run business, and the service is great.  Unless they're super busy I always ask where the item is that I need.  They'll walk you right over to it, and you can then spend all the time you need to decide which brand to buy.  Of course, I end up asking \""Which of these two are more popular\""  And they give their honest opinion.\n\nI like that in season, they have some fresh produce. They have some freshly roasted peanuts which were $1.90 a pound.  We actually boil them for a nice snack. Almost always they have cooking bananas, sometimes they have papayas, fresh coconut, oranges, melons, etc. My mom often sends us here to get various noodles for pancit, along with lumpia, perhaps the most popular Filipino dishes. The dish that most of our friends love the most is dinuguan, roughly translated, \""made from  pork blood\"".  When you add coconut milk lean pork, vinegar, salt, and sometimes innards like intestines, spices like bay leaf and black pepper, garlic, onion, etc...the flavor is quite unique, mild slightly sweet. My doc says this is a great dish if you have iron poor blood. \n\nAt the front counter are desserts made by Valerio's bakery. I find myself always buying something sweet.  This trip for $10 I bought a taro and sweet rice tootsie roll shaped dessert coated with coconut called Puto Bong Bong.  They also had a multi layer, multi colored sweet rice cake called Sapin Sapin. There were lots more, but everything in moderation  \n\nWe've been customers since 2007 and will continue to be as long as they're around.",616068

As a main, I had the meatballs, which had a good taste, but once again were not hot enough. My friend ordered a salad and opted to get the grilled shrimp. For $5 she got three shrimp, which isn't a bad deal, I guess. But it kicked the cost of the entire salad to $12, and it wasn't worth it at that price.\n\nThe service was OK. Our server was friendly, and while he didn't apologize for the slow service or cold food, one got the feeling that it wasn't his fault and the kitchen was having issues. And this was well after the place opened, when most places have all the issues figured out.

2,"If you're headed there for  the lunch hour, you probably should put your \""out of office\"" on your email because you'll be there for at least the next two hours. \n\nAlas, when I saw that there was a lunch special (about $10 for a half salad and pizza), I figured it would be a relatively typical lunch hour. Usually places that have lunch specials abide by the 1-hour lunch rule, but definitely not this place--at least, not in this instance. Holy moly, I had no idea that it took so long to make salad and pizza at Humble Pie. I am a regular at Sauce Pizza + Wine, and it usually takes them about 3 minutes to bring my salad after ordering, then another 5 minutes to have my pizza out. I think we were about 45 minutes into being at Humble Pie when our salads were brought out. I think my coworker was about ready to eat his shirt at that point.\n\nAlright, so how good was this hyped up place? Well...it was ok. First, I was a little surprised that the restaurant was small and the tables were kind of cramped, but I guess that adds to the ambiance of being a humble place. I ordered the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was OK, but not very flavorful. It kind of tasted like a salad I'd make at home. My pizza was a standard pepperoni, to which I added on olives. The pepperoni is the smaller diameter style pepperoni found at some other specialty pizza joints like Grimaldi's. It was uber salty and greasy, which felt very sinful as I was eating it. I think there was enough pepperoni on the pizza to cover 2 or 3 pizzas, actually. The crust, cheese and sauce were good, however. I suppose I should have ordered a veggie pizza or something a little less meaty to enjoy my meal.\n\nOverall, the food was OK, but nothing out of the ordinary special that I'd die to take my friends to. At least the service is pretty good (aside from the kitchen being super low), so I suppose I'd be OK with going back and giving it another shot...on a weekend.",364875

The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.  And just to be fair to them, I clearly remembered talking on the phone with one of my friends before heading over to the liquor store.  So the chance that I lost my phone in the liquor store is very highly! On top of that, the liquor is ghetto as hell and doesn't have plastic cup for customers.

4,"So you get yourself a puppy or an adult dog and you find yourself with two choices.\n\n1. Don't train your dog.

Go to dog training classes. \n\nYeah, number 2 is the right answer. For a very reasonable price ($125) we signed up Anka our brand new 3 month old puppy. Anka is a strong-willed German Shepherd with a high drive and before training was happy to do anything SHE wanted to. After completing our 8 week training class, Anka can now sit, down, wait, stay on command and come when called. She walks on a leash wonderfully now. She doesn't jump up on people any more and she is a lot more comfortable amongst other dogs and people.\n\nLeah is very knowledgeable and patient. She spends time both with the class as a whole and with your dog individually. Every one of the dogs in our class improved dramatically over the course of 8 weeks. The transformation was quite amazing to see.\n\nI picked Leah because of her history with German Shepherds, but she knows about all dogs.

The attendant replied with uncertainty and told me \""no\"", then said \""maybe in the back\"" and then \""no\"" again. I asked the attendant specifically if there would be a problem if I locked my bike up to a post or railing somewhere. The attendant didn't know or didn't think it would be a problem. I was very sure to show the attendant my concern for locking my bike to an undesignated post but it felt okay to do so according to the response. I proceed through the valet and into the parking garage to first look for a designated bike rack or bike area. After climbing several floors I came across nothing to be designated and proceeded to look for a railing. I came across an old and obviously unused stairway and locked up my bike using a Kryptonite lock and cable to the side of the staircase. I positioned my bicycle in a very thoughtful manner to make sure my handlebars or any extremity were in no way going to block the access of the staircase. I met a friend, we joined a poker tournament and I left roughly 2 hours later. My bike was gone. No evidence of anything was left behind. Immediately it felt like a security issue vs a theft issue. It takes a lot of work to break a Kryptonite U-Lock. I was outraged but I kept my cool and expressed my disgust professionally. \nValet called up security and immediately security became sarcastic and admitted they cut my lock and took my bike because it was illegally locked to a stairway. I then quickly began to explain how I spoke with valet about the bike rack situation and how there was no concern with locking my bike to a post or railing somewhere. Of course they didn't care and had very foolish reasons why they did what they did.  They told me that I should have asked security where to park my bike and not valet, but who would ever think to ask security? Valet seems like the more obvious to me. The security continued to tell me that if I would have asked them, they would have directed me towards the Bell desk and Bell would have taken care of it for me. Who would have thought Bell will take care of your bikes for you? And why aren't the valet trained to tell you that? \n\nI demand an apology and a $25 check to cover the cost of my lock. I will not let this go until I get what I deserve but either way this casino and Caesars Management in general have lost all my respect.",632872
1,"Sometimes I feel like my food life is a giant episode of the \""Twilight Zone.\""\n\nHow Burger Bar is ranked as high as it is is truly beyond me.  In fact, many Yelpers I respect and normally agree with love this place but man, I haven't felt this ripped off since I bought my HDDVD player. \n\nMaybe Im biased against these so-called \""gourmet burger\"" spots.  I mean, what makes a hamburger great is that its approachable by everyone, regardless of economics.  Perhaps thats why it has come to be synonymous with America...that it crosses boundaries.   Not here however, these burgers are decidedly expensive and in reality no better than anything you'd find at your favorite local burger joint.  \n\nJust because you use the word \""kobe\"" or \""danish blue cheese\"" doesn't mean you have the right to charge $20 bucks for a burger...but apparently here it does.  Another thing is one would think a gourmet burger place would have gourmet fries right?  Wrong...here the fries were so mediocre I was yearning for Chili's.......yep, thats right I said Chili's and now I must shower to wash the shame off my body.  \n\nI had Hubert's favorite burger which was composed of Buffalo, Bleu Cheese and sherry shallot reduction sauce.  It tasted ok, but the price...oh that price!  Would you spend 15 bucks for a gourmet hot dog?  You would tell me to jump off a bridge!  My mom had the sliders and reported them as being ok as well, but nothing special.\n\nService was average but not very friendly.  I mean I would have a smile if I was getting a 10 dollar tip for bringing out two hamburgers and a couple soda pops but who am I to judge?\n\nOne positive thing to note was Burger Bar did have a nice beer selection with some unique options at decent prices.  Its nice to be free from the normal yoke of beer oppression perpetrated by the casinos.\n\nI for one can pass on this place again but judging by the crowd there and the reviews on Yelp, most people disagree.....Twilight Zone I tells ya!!!!",155345

4,"Great Harvest's bread and customer service @ Rea Road is over-the-top!  The staff who work there are always friendly and go the extra mile for the customer.  I stopped by to pick up two gluten free bread loaves they had on hold for me; my wife is gluten intolerant, but not allergic.  While talking with the to person behind the desk (later found out to be one of the owners), they encouraged me to try a loaf of their spelt bread. She explained that it is similar to wheat but has a different protein, and often people who think they are intolerant to gluten, can often eat Great Harvest's spelt loafs because they are made with great, wholesome ingredients.  Wow did the spelt bread taste good!  My wife had no reaction to it either.  Our next step is to try some of their wheat loafs.  We are so excited that my wife may have the option of eating real bread again!  Thank you Great Harvest Bread Company @ Rea Road.",419322

2,COMPED ROOM - MARDI GRAS TOWER\n\nLast month I comped 4 free nights at Bally's. The room at Bally's was spacious. There were two things I didn't like at Bally's. First the pool was closed due to the season. Second the bridge from Bally's to The Cromwell was closed. \n\nI was excited that I was able to comp 4 free nights at Harrah's. When I checked in Monday I was given a room at the Mardi Gras Tower. To my disbelief I was shocked how small the room was. This room looked like a closet that was expanded. The room was so cramped as it appeared the bed was squished between the wall and balcony. The worst part of the room was it was located on the Strip where music was playing at the Carnival Court. When I tried to go to sleep at night I had to use earplugs. I enjoyed the vuvuzela sound four years ago at World Cup in South Africa than the noise from the Strip at night.\n\nThe reasons I didn't give a smaller rating were that I comped a room and swam at the pool.,129059
1,"I was a person that used to go to Serendipity since it opened in 09 and to be honest it  has been going downhill.  There were many problems I had with my last experience there a while back.\n1.  Prices are ridiculously expensive for majority of the food and drinks I remember when the Deep Fried Oreos used to be 14 dollars and now it's 18 IF you are a total rewards member\n2.  The ice cream I received for the Black and White Sundae was old.  The waiter tried telling me that they get \""Fresh\"" ice cream every day, but I'm a local who used to be a regular and I KNOW for a FACT how the ice cream is supposed to be like.  I'm pretty sure most of you know that when you put your spoon through ice cream it should be smooth and creamy, there SHOULD NOT BE ANY ice crystals inside of the ice cream making it a bit hard and chunky.  I mean its sad that the Ice cream at McDonald's is a lot more fresh than this place gave me for their Black N White Sundae.  Not only that but the Strawberry was pretty lazy to me if they raised the prices.  The reason why it's called a black and white sundae isn't because chocolate and vanilla ice cream, they used to have the strawberries in tuxedos now it's just half dipped in chocolate and white chocolate. I was dissatisfied with this and this was the first time I ever had to RETURN AN ORDER OF ICE CREAM\n3.  The LV Burger was OK wasn't really worth the price to me at all.  If the price was lowered a bit it would have been a lot better.\n4.  The people gave us the grasshopper in exchange for the horrible Black N White Sundae and it wasn't that great it was mediocre at best.  It was OK, but not anything too phenomenal at all.\n\nI would recommend just going here once now just to say you've been here or get like a Frozen Hot Chocolate to go, but other than that you can find something better",383044
3,"Got in quick, got out in a reasonable amount of time for what was being done.  Got a list of stuff that needs to be done to car...stuff I already figured needed.

1,"Upon my recent stay, I was disappointed that the night manager upon check-in did not honor my marquis suite upgrade for a discounted rate when booked months prior to my stay. He charged me the full amount for a room upgrade and reasoning was because the hotel had less then 10 rooms available the day of check-in despite all the marquis suite's being unbooked. When I spoke to the day manager the next day, he pretty much hinted that the hotel didn't want to honor their room upgrade and wanted more money. Why offer a discounted upgrade in the first place. This honestly was my favorite hotel in Vegas. This is no longer the case.",276174
3,"Great neighborhood venue but needs to work through its kitchen and service issues.  Only open about a week.  Restaurant is nicely updated and inviting.  Back patio is open and lively.  Food was good once you got it.  Our server was great and manager, once he appeared, appropriately apologetic.  Comped a meal and gave us a dessert.  I want them to be successful so we will certainly give them another chance.\n\nSo we went the next night with other friends.  Like I said, we really want this restaurant to be successful.  Service was somewhat better, course we had the attention of the manager.  Still got some things to work out...its slow and forgetful.  The food is quite good.  We sat on the patio which is great.  As we were leaving about 8:30 - 3 bus loads of ASU college students were arriving.  OMG!.  They are not prepared for that kind of crowd yet.  I'm sure they had a good time anyway.\n\nI'm upgrading my rating to 4stars.  I've been there 5 times and each time service gets better and better.  Food is always very good. My husband had a pork chop that was heaven on earth.  It's not on the menu any more but ask.  Drinks are now coming quickly and they haven't forgotten anything (ok except for the apples on the apple Gorgonzola salad which was more hysterical than anything) in the last 2 visits.  We live a hop, skip and a jump away so it's becoming \""our place\"".   Give it a try.",592620

3,"Okay, I live up the street. I remember when this was a small, open air mall. Times have changed. It's huge. It has everything from sports memorabilia to Italian fashion. It's a place where I like to people-watch. I'm not a big customer here because the place just has a bit too much of the \""Snottsdale\"" feeling to it. By that I mean people trying to impress each other and themselves. They never buy much, but they walk around with their noses in the air. That's okay. It's the culture of Scottsdale and I accept that. It is fun to sit down and observe and listen in on the one-upmanship that goes on. \n\nI patronize many of the companies that are represented at SFS, just not there. I waled into one store for an item I knew they carried. The sales girl had no clue. I pointed to it and she picked up the wrong one. They have an AT&T store which is virtually bare of products. Why? But this isn't a criticism of the mall, but of Scottsdale and this mall gives Scottsdale what it wants: Image and little substance. \n\nBut that's the community this mall serves and it's a good fit. I don't need to pay to see the circus when I can come here for free. It's just plain amusing.",159146
4,"I love Mandalay Bay! \n\nWhen you walk through the doors you get a whiff of a fresh breezy tropical lotiony scent . Located on the strip one of the first hotels you come across. Delano is also a part of mandalay. There are a great selection of shops... Lush is here too! \n\nThere is a tram or indoor walk route that leads you to Luxor Excalibur New York New York. \n\nRooms have tubs which I like. They have a cardio exercise room downstairs that's open to guests but the gym is part of the spa and they charge a fee for daily access. \n\nThere is a chapel, food court with subway etc, shark reef aquarium that's about $18-20 per person\n\nMy favorite thing about MB is their pools. Wave pool, lazy river pool with waterfalls. The best during the summer.\n\nLight is also here too.",172031

Me and a few of my girlfriends hit up babystacks to devour some pancakes after yelping breakfast spots to eat. We ordered the stack of red velvet pancakes, banana cream pancakes, strawberry pancakes, two orders of garlic fried rice, AND an order of their seasoned fries. A weird mix of salty and sweet but whatever! The rice was on point, down to the last grain. The seasoned fries were crispy to perfection and the pancakes were fluffy and tasty!! The fruits were all fresh, their homemade whip cream was thick and creamy, and the toppings were so delicious and sweet. You know their food is bomb when you cant recommend one pancake over the other. All were so goooood!",480706
0,"Nothing Joyful about it. Worst I've had in years. The restaurant is in a failing strip mall. No windows, dark and dingy and it smelled of Pine sol.  Staff did not greet us with a smile ( I can't blame them, maybe too depressed). We went at lunchtime and the place was empty - save for one table.  I ordered the Kung Pao as a safe bet. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the sauce was salty - tasted mostly like soy sauce. I thought maybe it was just me, so I took the rest home for my husband. He said it was \""inedible\"". Then I told him where I went and he said \""I could have told you that, that place is awful\"". \nMy friend ordered the Shrimp in Lobster sauce, she said it was ok, but she would never go back. The egg rolls were soggy and greasy and the fried rice was non nondescript. I have no idea why anyone would give this place 5 stars! I know it's been around a while - maybe they are regulars.",45920

2,"I've biked past Union Grill countless times as its $10 wine list sign blinks tauntingly but never stopped until recently.\n\nBesides the $10 wine list (yes, Union Grill has about 8+ different bottles of wine to choose from all for $10), Union Grill is known for its burgers. \n\nThese half-pound burgers are made from dry-aged ribeye, sirloin, brisket and chuck, which are then ground into a burger. Burgers are accompanied by lettuce, tomato, onions, and a dill pickle and served with your choice of cole slaw, waffle fries, sweet potato chips, vegetable of the day, or rosted garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nEven though the Five-hour Pot Roast was so very tempting, I went with the Blue UG. It came topped with imported English Stilton Blue Cheese and the accouterments. I choose waffle fries as my side and also the Homemade Steakburger Sauce.\n\nWhile I waited I entertained myself with some of that $10 wine. Always a good choice in my book. The burger came out a smidge more done than I asked (medium) but the quality made up for that. The flavor of the beef was exceptional. You can tell no pink goo was used in crafting this behemoth. This thing was thick and juicy (the bun suffered a bit) and as a result I committed one of my cardinal sins: I cut the burger in half. Gasp. I quickly got over it. The blue cheese was mild and creamy as it melted and the steakburger sauce (tasted like a richer, and spicier A1 sauce) really pulled the whole thing together. The waffle fries were tasty but didn't seem like they were made on-site.\n\nIt was throughly enjoyable and hit my burger craving spot oh so right.\n\nUnion Grill's menu has classic American favorites like Turkey Devonshire and Tuna Melts, and the atmosphere is friendly, inviting, and reminds you a 1980's game room (in a good way). These reasons plus more are why it was jam-packed with diners at 9 p.m. and will continue to be so for a long time to come. I'll be back... for that pot roast. You can count on that.",150356
3,"There are actually things grown in the Las Vegas area available at this market, but you have to know where to look!  The California stuff is nice (citrus, strawberries and Central Valley supplements), but thanks to Gilcrease, Herbs by Diane from Boulder City and another vendor or two there is the option to buy from actual local sources.  This certainly beats any of the other Fresh 52 markets in terms of vendors and variety.\n\nThe parking was tight and I had to stalk someone for a spot.  Also, the indoor vendors are a little oddly place...why?  Not a bad idea, just unusual and strangely formatted.  Certainly a nice option for adverse weather, but that indoor venue also got crowded and congested as any setting with lots of lingering folks.\n\nI was pleased to come away with things I could never find in a commercial grocery superstore including corn shoots, a massive and beautifully misshapen romanesco cauliflower, tender and huge stalks of purple asparagus and a variety of luscious citrus without stickers attached.",512403
2,"I've gone to Dragon Fly twice now.  Once on a blind date and once with my partner and kids.  The blind date experience was okay; thank God they have $5 martinis-of-the-day.  \n\nMy return visit with my partner (not the blind date) and his kids was more enjoyable, but still nothing spectacular.  Dragon Fly offers your basic Chinese dishes that you'd find on a Chinese take-out menu, but they serve them to you in their dining room.  Good, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nOur server wasn't very attentive until the very end when we didn't want him to be.  We were seated and brought some of those crunchy Chinese noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard sauce.  With five of us, they were gone in no time and we never did see a refill.  And I liked that they had a $5 sour apple martini drink special, but my 2nd martini didn't come until I was done eating my meal.  It kind of ruins the excitement of drinking a martini when it's served as dessert.  Well...mostly.  Toward the end of the meal (not at the end, but toward the end), our server started clearing our dishes off our table before we were even finished!   My partner had turned away for a second and someone scarfed up his plate with some food still on it.  This infuriated my partner, but I, surprisingly, wasn't as bothered.  Maybe it was because I knew that \""dessert\"" was coming?  \n\nAt any rate, the food is average, drink specials on martinis are great, and the service is slow, but keep an eye on your plate.

1,"Was recommended by the concierge at our hotel. Went on a Fri. nite around 6:45pm. Drove up and parking lot was dead, not a good sign. After being seated the waiter came around, it was hard to hear him over the music. When the food came it was, for the most part, disappointing. The tempura was light and not at all greasy. Sauces were pretty good but it stopped there. Those who had the sushi weren't blown away. Expectations were high as the waiter informed us that Roka Amor was voted best sushi restaurant in the country?! One person ordered the waygu beef and it was way too fatty. The pork belly appetizer, again way too fatty. The chicken teriyaki, I have had better. On the whole, the atmosphere and food were underwhelming. I'm confused by the rave reviews.

The pizza? Well, it was passable. Definitely not the best pizza, but far from the worst. \n\nWould I go there again? Perhaps.

2,"Curry in the Box is consistently decent. It's not spectacular, but it's predictable and tastes quite good. The renovations are nice, and the atmosphere has improved considerably. \n\nIn the past, I have gotten Panang Chicken, Roti, Volcano Chicken, Crab Rangoon, and Spring Rolls. All of them are tasty and flavored well, and remarkably reasonably priced. \n\nThe service is excellent; the people are friendly and the food is ready very quickly.

I asked for no squid but it was still on my plate. Normally most place cannot cook squid well and it was confirmed here. Sliced with skin and rubbery with a too salty flavor that tells me not only was it old but overcooked. However the sauce was very tasty, pasta was al dente n the rest of the seafood cooked well - although the mussels were a little briny. \nI also got to try a chicken dish with an amazing white cream sauce prosciutto and I think peas.
