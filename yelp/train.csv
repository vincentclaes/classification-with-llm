3,"I've been to this place plenty of times before, & every time I've been here, I would definitely give 5 stars. I gave 3 stars because our server Scheila, was just completely horrible last night. I had an iced tea that didn't get offered to be refilled once. She kept refilling our waters but didn't ask at all if I wanted more iced tea. Of course I had to ask for it... I don't know if you pay by the glass for iced tea at this resturant but it would still be a little nice for her to ask. I don't think she even asked if we were doing ok the whole time we were sitting! The meat of course was beyond amazing. The lobster bisque is what I look forward to every time I'm headed here, if you haven't had it, you need to try it. It is one of the best soups I've ever had! Not exaggerating. We wanted more of the fried bananas and it felt like we had to hunt down our server for more. After all the food we had no idea where the waitress, so it was like an hour until we got our check. This is the first time we had a discount here, it was something like a buy one get one free coupon. Thank goodness we had that or else I would of been a little disappointed spending full price on the service we got. I'm thinking this whole bad service thing is because we were sitting in the corner, right next to her drink stand. But at the same time, you'd think she would come to the drink stand more often & see us. I'm not sure. I will definitely be back to this resturant because I love it so much, I will just remember not to ask for her.",347680

1,"Expensive gimmick.  Missleading website.  Wide angle lens camera makes it look big but is smaller than my kitchen.  For $25 dollars to get in, it was a real disappointment.  We felt ripped off.  Plus the free drink was absolutely aweful; it reminded me of the trash can parties we went to in college.",356065
4,"I was looking for last minute hotels and stumbled upon The Riviera. I saw they had an offer one bed deluxe suite for 60.00 that included your living room with a wet bar, 2 bathrooms, a bedroom with a huge bed with a balcony with a decent view to the strip 60  a night sounded awesome.Then I read the reviews and was terrified and of course there was no refund if we cancelled. When we got there checking it wasn't as terrible like people said, but of course we got there at 6pm when check in was at 3pm but we checked in with no problem. We stayed on the Monte Carlo tower on the 26th floor, the one bedroom deluxe suite was very spacious the rooms are outdated but they're not THAT bad what really is in need of a renovation are the bathrooms. \nThe Riviera isn't the typical glamorous hotel you see at the middle of the strip, it's a blast from the past. I thought it was nice being able to experience a much older hotel, it's pet friendly also. Getting to our room wasn't such a long walk like in the other hotels. It's pretty far from all the shows but that's nothing a simple cab ride or a car ride can fix. This hotel isn't as packed as others it's very nice to walk around or catch a break from the night life. Overall it was a nice stay I enjoyed it staff was friendly, I hope they begin to fix their bedrooms soon and update many things (:\nIf you want an updated nice bedroom ask for the Monaco tower",133615
2,"We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average; your basic bar food, some with a Cajun flair.  From the grungy feel of the restaurant, I wouldn't want to experiment too much with food here, especially where seafood is concerned.  \n\nIf you're in college, like to party, and in your early to mid-twenties, Dixie's may seem like a cool hangout place.  If you're anything else, there are better options in Uptown.",6645
3,"I got the eggs benedict (of course! I get them everywhere). They were really good. The eggs were done perfectly, the Canadian bacon wasn't overcooked and was a thick slice, and they put just enough sauce. The hashbrowns weren't bad, but were a little mushy.\nService is the reason for not getting 4 stars. Phuong was my server and kept calling me lady, I hate that. It took her a while to get to the table, she was hiding out in  the back since they weren't busy when I got here. In total I think she came to the table like 3 times.",307452
5,"Love Tempe Marketplace, I prefer this Harkins over Cinemark. There's always nice people with great service and you're not waiting at concession for an oblivious worker to serve you and get in when your movie is starting like Cinemark. Also seems cheaper than Cinemark most days. Love the 3D they added! Love the seats, the food, the clean, everything. Can't beat it!",279224
3,"teharu gets three stars for the price, the fact that it has a conveyor belt, and the haru roll-crab salad wrapped in tuna with avocado on top. the sushi is meh, i'm not sure why they have servers, and it's usually a wait but it's good every once in a while",317904
3,"Wonderfully kitschy chic.\n\nMany people dressing like people they see on TV in Vegas. Self-fulfilling prophecy and very fun.\n\nChandelier Bar, GoGo Bar are both great.\n\nMilos and Scarpetta are also very serviceable, in fact the service is better than the food.",435695
5,I love this place. My husband and I were able to share a meal because the portions are so big. The food is amazingly delicious.,55323
5,"Love love love this place! Came here w my BFF. Found it on yelp. Service was fantastic. Above and beyond. Not only did they do a great mani pedi for my friends but they also gave me a VIP room w blanket, an awesome bed to rest in and TV while I was waiting. The manager  even offered to feed my fruit. Ha. Love love love this place. I woulda given it 10 stars if it was possible!!!",440330
4,"Wonderful Fresh Food, I highly recommend them",51283
2,"This is probably the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. I Understand that they get busy but I've been to many locations with long lines that move quickly. This location however, is the SLOWEST one in the world. \n\nThe line is always to the door and you can expect to wait 15-20 minutes before paying. Most of the workers are soooo slow. Each time I've been in they are always low on meat or guacamole and you have to stand there and wait minutes for it to be replaced. \n\nAlso the parking is horrible. The \""lot\"" is super tiny. Tonight there was no parking available and I had to park across the street at the mall and walk over. \n\nAll in all I'm done coming here. I'd rather drive to 7th and Bell for good service and parking.",518933
5,"This place is legit!!! My first time after hearing about it from friends.  I am definitely returning and OFTEN.  The flavor was intense for me and authentic.  I split some food with friends and had half of the pastrami sandwich and a slice of pizza which was very yummy! Of course, I couldn't leave without trying their spumoni which topped it all...bits of chocolate and pistachios mixed within the flavors. Prices were very reasonable. Wanting my next date night there :)",259076
2,"Before I jump into my review I want to say that this place isn't necessarily \""Meh\"" for everyone. I've had many a massage for varying prices and quality, so based on that is why this place gets 2-stars.  I picked this place to go based on the reviews, but I guess I have a more picky palette when it comes to people touching me.\n\nCOST - Yes, this place is probably the cheapest and more decent for the price for a regular massage. But, I've had massages for about the same price in Hawaii that was better (And Hawaii is expensive as hell, like Las Vegas). I paid $89 for a 90 minutes massage.  It's a decent price I think, but just comparatively, I've had better for close to the same cost, if not cheaper.\n\nMASSAGE EXPERIENCE - Maybe I'm jaded or have been getting massages wrong for the past couple years, but usually when I get I massage they start with my back since usually there is the most tension there is probably requires the most attention, but what do I know? I'm not a massage therapist, but what I can say is that everything else was done first and my back last.  That's not something I'm use to and whether or not that is normal is for a pro to determine, but what I can say is that I feel like my back needed a lot more attention.  Also my neck needed a lot more attention, as I type this my neck hurts. That was one of the first things worked on, which I usually like ending with that.  I could mention many other things about my massage experience that had me unimpressed, but the order of things was a major one.\n\nAMBIANCE - The room itself was great. No complaints here.  Probably one of the better rooms I've had a massage in. As for the building, it was in the midst of renovations, which I can't complain about, but it just made the place look shady.\n\nPAYMENTS???? - Okay, so I made my appointment online, which I think is weird because if I don't know anything about massages, how am I to know what \""type\"" is best for my ailments?  Not only that, but they missed an opportunity to get me to spend more money, but because I did not understand their ordering system I just bought whatever massage I was familiar with.  I would've totally done more, but there was no customer service to sell me on more.  Not only was I peeved about that, but I had to pay for my appointment before I even got massaged.  That is ODD. Who does that? But I paid for it anyway.  I was peeved again that I could not add a tip to my payment, so I had to go withdraw cash before I came in and I did not know the neighborhood.\n\nOVERALL - Meh, seriously, but I'm basing this off the fact that I've been to many a massage therapist.  I'm a bit of a snob and usually when I find someone good I stay with that person, but I have yet to find someone in Las Vegas for me. :(",72485
5,I've been going to Matt Martin for years! What he's capable of doing is nothing short of a miracle. Both of my teenage daughters go to him as well - they love all of his suggestions and the results. \n\nLove the new location too. Highly recommend The Parlor!,631496
4,This is the mall I go to when its to hot to visit Town Square or for something different. They have alot of stores I like and the food court is nice. They even have a toddler play area there..which can be handy after a few hours of your little one being in a stroller.\nDuring Easter they have a cute bunny for the kids to take pix with but @ Xmas the Santa is better @ Town Square. He has his own house there.\nI still manage to get here every couple of weeks and usually leave with a bag from somewhere..,278159
4,What a great location for Happy Hour when it isn't searing hot to sit on the patio. Sunday brunch is pretty fab here too since they used to have bottomless mimosa's. Try the Ahi taco's for Happy Hour!  The staff is pretty attentive once you get a table but it rubs me the wrong way when high school hostesses act as if you are an inconvenience or pretending they work at a club,447123
5,"Best New Restaurant in Las Vegas!\n\nNove is aces....for everything.....service, food, ambience....you name it and Nove delivers.\n\nNove is the perfect place to have a romantic dinner, or dine with friends, or pre-party before heading up to Moon or the Playboy Club.  How many restaurants can be romantic and clubby at the same time?  Nove fits in well with The Palms.   \n\nThe food is fantastic.  I would recommend the starter of tomato soup and grilled cheese.  It's an interesting take on a classic item.  The portions are large so keep that in mind as you order.\n\nI had my birthday dinner here, and the host was so nice, and sent over a shot of champagne.  I had never really had a \""shot\"" of champagne before, but it was cute nonetheless.\n\nOur server, Joey, was dynamite.  He had such a great personality, did not rush us through our dinner, and had excellent recommendations.  At the end of the night, he ushered us up to the Playboy Club!",216723
5,I absolutely love Caribou Coffee especially this location because it's located in the beautiful South Park/ Fox Croft area! The baristas here are super friendly and if your looking for a nice place to study or get work done on your laptop this location is not too noisy it has a beautiful cozy cabin feel to it!,9027
1,"My husband and I walked in about 8:30 on a Wednesday night and asked for a table for 2.  The hostess was completely thrown that we had just walked in and didn't have a reservation.  As in, she really didn't know what to do.  As she sat there looking confused and looking around the restaurant, my husband suggested that we could grab a drink at the bar while she figured it out.  She looked relieved and went off to talk to a gentleman who worked there (we presumed about our seating).  \n\nMeanwhile husband ordered a martini, and I a glass of $18 wine.  At least it was a big pour.  The wine list was out of control expensive without being out of control excellent.  My baseline is Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label - in the local wine stores here, I can buy it retail for $35-40/bottle.  On this menu, it was $125.  After having a tremendous bottle of Rioja the night before at Stripsteak (at $85) that we were still reminiscing about while at the bar, we decided that by the glass was probably the best way to go.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we determined that our previous night's meal was so good, that neither of us would be opposed to going back if we weren't going to be seated by the end our our drinks.  Ten minutes later, husband paid the bar tab, the hostess was nowhere to be seen, and we took off for another delicious steak down the strip.",198291
4,I come here for sporting events all the time. Arizona alumni club is here. The atmosphere is wonderful and food is good. I'm sad it's closing.,388994
2,"For the price, this place is seriously below par. \n\nI had a 40-minute sugar scrub/massage, for around $140. The treatment itself was fine, and the therapist was personable and efficient. The room was relaxing and pleasant, though the music was more elevator-style adult contemporary than traditional Zenlike spa music. Kinda lame.\n\nThe spa facilities are what really suck, though. If you want a massage, fine -- pay the $180 and get your treatment; then get the hell out. I can do a better spa day at my cheap-ass gym!!!\n\nThere is no reason to loiter here. The \""relaxation room\"" is bland, stocked with tea, apples and vapid Vegas magazines. The rest of the facility consists of a tiny locker room, teeny bathroom, and a steam room. That's it. If you want to soak in a whirlpool, you have to go OUT IN THE CASINO, down the hall, down the elevator, down another hall, and outdoors to the pool area. All this in your spa robe and slippers! And I visited in January -- WAY too cold to be walking outdoors in a wet robe!!\n\nI came with three girlfriends, and the place wasn't big enough for all of us. There are only two showers, and one was broken...so we had to take turns. The vanity area in the locker room was tiny, and one of the blow dryers was broken, so most of us just went up to our rooms to get ready. Keep this in mind if you're planning a spa day for your bridal party or something like that -- this place is only big enough to accommodate 2 guests at a time. Besides which, it sucks.\n\nIf I'm paying $140 for a massage, I want a fancy experience, dammit! Otherwise I'd just go to Massage Envy.",535914
5,"GORGEOUS!\n\nThe shops, the bars, the restaurants, the whole place was pristine and immaculate. Awesome structural design throughout and amazing floral designs.\n\nOnly walked around and drank at a few bars here but  it is super awesome. I would love to stay here sometime soon. It is a bit on the pricey side though.",132247
5,"GREAT! I am a tough customer, and I love this place, the food and the service!\nI have eaten there 4 times, have recommended it to several persons and no one was disappointed.\nIt is new, new management, new chef, new atmosphere , all special! \nyou will truly feel special when you are a customer there unlike most AZ formula restaurants.\n\ngive them a try you will love it all, food, service, music(yes, you can talk with your guests , the music is not too loud and adds to the ambiance).\n\nDeborah",546858
3,"Not very happy with Craig right now. The station has a cash price and credit price listed, cash is .05\u00a2 cheaper. I used my FRN card which have me a .05\u00a2 discount too AND I paid with cash. However Craig said I'm only eligible for one discount... well, the folks at FRN disagree. We'll see what happens...",146394
2,"I'd have to say the best thing they have are nachos and chilli cheese fries. Hot dogs? Eh, pass...\n\nI only went here because I was tired of walking on the strip and hungry in my hotel room. The food was expensive, but I'm not surprised. I'm in Vegas...\n\nI'd probably only come back for their fries or nachos. Other then that, I'm definitely eating somewhere else.",208333
1,"Small Business BEWARE!  Do not ever conduct business with this organization.  After putting you through a mile of paperwork, you will never get paid.  This is the most unprofessional organization I have ever had to deal with.  They will not return emails, phone call, letters or even have the courtesy to answer the phone.  They will take your product however....and never pay for it.",94203
3,"Overall: Come here for the crab legs, salad, shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp, the corn on the cob, free champagne and the tiramisu! Other than that, this buffet isn't anything special compared to the other ones. Wish they had better dessert selection (the ice cream are those machines from Souplantation, although they do have waffle cones). \n\nCompared to the other buffets, I feel like Bayside is on the lower end of the wow spectrum. I've eaten at Rio's buffet, Paris and the Spice Market, and I feel like all three of those were better than Bayside. The only reason we came here was because Mandalay Bay offered us $75 for us to spend on any of their dining facilities.  So for about $50 for four people, it was a pretty decent meal. \n\nThe price may be cheaper on regular days, but Vegas is really spicing things up and taking advantage of the Christmas season. No longer are the buffets only expensive on Christmas DAY, but they've taken the whole Christmas week and jacked up the prices by about $10 to $20 dollars! Because of this, there weren't that many people the night we ate here. Granted we arrived at around 5:30 for dinner, but we were seated fairly quickly. \n\nThey have different dining areas, but my mom wanted a table of its own rather than sitting at a booth connected to two other tables. We got a very nice table close to the salad bar with a very nice elderly waiter. Throughout the night I felt very sorry for just giving him all my plates of uneaten food or food I just wanted to try because he had so much to do and so many other people to serve. \n\nAnyway, there's the salad bar (with lots of different toppings - turkey, corn, mushroom, etc and a plethora of dressing), the Italian station, sushi/breakfast/shrimp cocktail, Asian food, an Italian pasta station, a prime rib/turkey/chicken station, crab legs, dessert and a champagne/beer bar section. \n\nThe champagne and beer are included in the fee you pay. I was so excited going up and asking for a champagne, and they didn't even card me! Anyway, the food selection is pretty good but the food itself isn't so great. The ribs were icky and cold, the prime rib tasted fake (just like at the Victorian Cafe!) and the pasta wasn't too tasty either. \n\nThe best things there were the shrimp cocktail, the salad, the fried shrimp, and the hot crab legs (make sure you get big ones as people tend to take those right away), the hot corn on the cob and the tiramisu! Loveeddd the tiramisu out of all the other desserts. I think I ate four or five of those in the little small cups. Left a tip for the waiter and left on a slightly happy (because of the tiramisu) slightly disappointed mood.",218512
1,Just an update to my previous review.  Here's a suggestion to the management:  Why are you charging someone twice for utilities when they move out?  When someone gives their sixty day notice just combine the charges for those final two months in just one bill instead of two separate billing statements.,399506
1,"The service and food were so bland it ruined a chunk of my evening.  If one insists on going, I recommend having a Peroni.  There is no way they could screw that up.  Simply open and pour.  Oh, unless you have our server, who will look at you with disdain because you're not ordering a bottle of wine.",176612
2,"We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say, the best part was the complimentary valet parking!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm, thinking the restaurant would be packed, only to find it about a quarter full.  Did we go to the right place?  From what I had heard, I expected there to be a line out the door like there was both times we went to Chima for past Restaurant Weeks.  It's a nice looking place, very open yet cozy, and it has a great bar area.  The server, John, was great and took good care of us, so no complaints there.  It was the food that was lackluster, and for the money, I wish we had gone elsewhere.  The bread was fresh and a good start (2 kinds, and a spread with olives as well as an oil and balsamic vinaigrette to wet it down). The Fattouch salads were good, though I question the use of iceberg lettuce for presentation as it looked like a low end salad with some red peppers, olives and a nasty tomato thrown in.  My partner had a Flat Iron Steak which he ordered medium well and got medium rare.  The first few bites were good, but it toughened as it cooled, and he had some difficulty cutting it as well as the asian broccoli (which he gave up on).  Being a vegan, I wasn't sure I would find anything to eat, but i did see a Mushroom Bolognese pasta dish that I ended up ordering.  It had a great taste, but the homemade pasta was a bit al dente and stuck together.  More like the wide rice noodles in some asian dishes.  Still, I enjoyed mine.  No vegan desert option for me (fresh fruit option, please?), but my partner ordered the chocolate cake and said it was good but very rich.  It all seemed to disappear, though, so that says something!  Overall, a decent dining experience, if we were spending maybe $40-50 max, tip included.  $30 each plus 2 iced teas ($6.98) and tip came to just under $90.  At least I felt like I got my one's worth with the valet at $5 for a tip, it saved me $1 off parking myself and then walking a block!  Still, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  With all the great dining our city has, I think there are better choices for the money...Ilios Noche comes to mind for great atmosphere, service and menu selection at about $20-25 less, and then we could still catch a movie!",7016
2,"Forget the hype....your neighborhood sushi place in a strip mall is probably better.  Sure you don't get the Vegas scene, but you also probably get better service, similar quality and a whole lot more money in left your pocket.  The only brief star of the night was the hostess stand.  Friendly to a fault, they patiently waited for my entire party of 6 a full 30 minutes after the reservation time - and they didn't punish us with a poor table or attitude.  The server was fair - guests at my table had to ask who they had to bribe to get their beer delivered - but what do you expect on a Sunday night at 8pm.....hmmm.  BTW - this restaurant is so noisy you can barely hear people at your own table.  Good luck.",162199
5,"One of my best finds in Arizona was Sierra Family Denistry after I found the dental office across the street from them to be sub-par. Dr. Rauschel and his staff are awesome, caring, fun & professional people - we love them. My husband and I have gotten excellent dental care there, including crowns and extractions, and every experience has been pleasant. Definitely give them a try if you're looking for a dentist in the East Valley!",38555
3,This place is definitely a dive but I can't say its not delicious. The wings aren't as scrawny as most places I go to;they are actually good meaty wings.The hot garlic is probably my favorite sauce because I can't get it anywhere else. The fried zucchini is also awesome. Service and food is great but the atmosphere could use some work.,359171
5,"So much high quality selection! Thai, fresh fresh sushi, wonton soup with \nAll the fixings! They had crab legs and an amazing salad station. We got discounted tickets at tix4tonight so for $17 bucks we did well. You can pay double this amount for food at Caesars or the Cosmo but the biggest difference is presentation not tastiness.",295130
3,"I remember when I was younger and saw the Luxor for the first time. I wanted to stay there! When visiting Vegas recently, I decided to fork out the cash to satisfy my inner child. I don't regret staying in the Luxor - it was clean and quiet - but it wasn't what I was expecting. It's just a middle class hotel, really, and if that's what you want and the Luxor is offering a good rate, then go for it. Just make sure to learn about the resort fee before you make your reservation.\n\nAs for my experience, the Luxor was clean but the shower drain was clogged, causing an overflow onto the bathroom floor. Our room had a view of the strip, although being on the south end of the strip, the view wasn't impressive at all. The sloped window was impressive for all of two seconds. Check-in was a breeze. Finally, I'll mention that the salespeople working the hotel floor were a little annoying.",170998
3,"This was my third year attending Bite of Las Vegas. Is it just me or is Switchfoot the main headliner EVERY year? I was very excited to hear that Sara Bareillis was performing as she is one of my favorite artists. \n\nI agree with Heather, even though there were the same amount of booths as last year, there were noticeably less FOOD booths. I even noticed some booth's charging $6 for certain items, I thought all portions were to be between $1-$5. \n\nThe parking situation was HORRIBLE, I knew not to park in the Flamingo/Twain but I was still stuck in the rocky gravel. It would be fine if they had some kind of control of the aisles. Their were huge gaps between rows and cars that could have made parking a lot easier for many. My friend mistakenly went to the Flamingo lot and was told the only way out was to jump the curb, in a Honda Accord! That is unacceptable at an event where there is an entrance fee. They should have enough money from ticket sales to afford proper parking attendants. Less American Idol rejects, more parking attendants!\n\nThe food was really good and I definitely overindulged, I do like the layout of the event. You basically make a loop and try out whatever you want.",408328
5,"Five stars! As good as it gets! \n\nI don't want to get THAT into it but I ran over my tow truck driver's foot. \n\nWell, I guess I will get into it. \n\nSo my car craps out on me. Lots of miles, lots of memories. Sure it is just an inanimate object. But this thing is so close to have been in all fifty states. Yes, ALL fifty (including Hawai'i). \n\nI digress. \n\nSo it is on on off-ramp of the 215. Disabled. I might or might not have checked in to CR-215 right before she broke down (a BIG fuck you to all the 'checking-in to beltways and parks and landmarks is pointless' crowd). \n\nAnyway, driver shows up. Gets the nifty ramp on his truck lowered and directs me to take the emergency brake off. Well, I do as told but must say that I do not keep my shift in gear. There are people that do and people who don't. I don't. What is the point? I always use the emergency brake. Fuck off, stop judging me. \n\nSo the car rolls. Fast. We are trying to stop it. Not working. Car suddenly stops. \n\nI get inside and pull the brake again. Driver, Cameron (?), points at his leg which is caught from the above the ankle down underneath my back tire. Car stopped suddenly because he used his foot like one uses a door stop, except on a car not a door and he used flesh and not rubbermaid\u00ae. \n\nFucking aye. \n\nCameron, or whatever his westernized name was, is Iraqi-American. We talked the whole way to the mechanic shop. Hardcore, albeit very kind and thoughtful, dude. \n\n777 Towing was just who USAA called up for my roadside assistance. They showed up well before the ETA and have at least one driver who will keep you entertained as you are driven to the shop. \n\n'Cameron' probably did not even have his foot checked out. He survived a goddamn civil war after all, he can survive me (or my car, really) running over his damn foot. They should give him a raise. - E",566564

2,"Service was fine - I sat at the bar.\nPartially this might be my mistake - i came here for late lunch.  I wasn't sure if I was into having an 8oz burger (ie the big bun) so I decided to go for the tiny buns (3 sliders per serve).\n\n2nd mistake - I ordered something other than a beef patty (pretty obvious this is a beef place).  I ordered the Ahi sliders.\n\nSo yes maybe other choices would have been better.  But for a place with burgers as main attraction as a burger?  The slider buns were very disappointing - cold and hard.  The Ahi had a spicy herb crust on the outside and tasted decent (nothing to rave about), the cucumber and slaw under the quartered piece of Ahi were actually in my opinion the highlight.  In fact I would have paid for that to be an Ahi cucumber salad much more happily.\n\nSweet potato fries I added were decent - but again not really memorable.\n\nThe redeeming thing?  The margarita I ordered was very nice.",490049
4,"I have no idea what this place is like at night, or during the weekday lunch rush, but for lunch on a Saturday...it's perfect.  Not very busy, so its easy to get a spot at the small bar, or about any table you would want.  I prefer to sit at the bar during the day.  It's also the best way to get to know a new spot.\n\nTacos are great, but the pernil asada tacos are excellent.  Chips and salsa are fresh and the salsa has a nice kick.\n\nHighly reccomend the jalepeno infused margarita.  Amazing how many truly awful margaritas are available in the valley, but they do them very well here.\n\nPrices are more than reasonable and the happy hour prices are great.\n\nHopefully this place can be the start of bringing back The Esplanade.",485401

1,"Horrible landlord, is always in a bad mood never shows up when she says she will. Will schedule an appointment and not show up and then will blame you when you question why she hasn't come yet. Horrible on respecting privacy will schedule maintenance before even telling you and will expect you to be fine with whatever date and time and when you need something done actually maintenance will take weeks if not months to do the job. \n\nDo not rent from these people unless you are a masochist.",87737
5,"I don't hand out five stars often - but in this case, I think they are warranted.  We can't say anything bad about this place.\n\nThe food is not typical Italian - it's Italian, but with a South Philadelphia flair.  Everything was very good - I don't know how much else I can say.  The tomatoes in the Caprese tasted like tomatoes.  The cheese (both Mozzarella and Ricotta) are made in house.  The meatball is to die for.  The desserts were good.\n\nOur waiter, Ben, was as good as they come - really - his service made our experience perfect.",435196

A cheeky face value ticket from the support act, you say? That'll do nicely thanks. (Aside; I abhor the middleman that comes with booking online so from now on I'm going through the actual acts themselves. Stick it to the Man, man!) \nClose to Waverley Station and nought but a short walk over North Bridge. It's got a nice cosy cave-like feel to it, ideal for gigs. Now I've not been on a 'night out' here and to be honest I'm not exactly bothered by that. Dark nooks & crannies are my favourite spots but no need to take a sudden deep interest in your shoes; your fellow patrons are friendly and it's not hard to strike up a pleasant conversation here. \nThere's one thing I really dislike about Cabaret Voltaire though and I think it puts a dampener on things; come 10pm, no matter, the place gets cleared out for a club night at 11pm. It's like your parents coming home annoyingly early and chucking your pals out. As well as you. And the entertainment. Uncool in my opinion. \n\nA-OK-and a half.",357765

All of them are tasty and flavored well, and remarkably reasonably priced. \n\nThe service is excellent; the people are friendly and the food is ready very quickly. It's a great place to go for a quick, cheap dinner.\n\nIn my opinion, Sa Bai Thong is the best Thai food in Madison, but Curry in the Box is a close second.",318801

We chose to enjoy the warm evening air on the misted patio.  It was perfect for our party of six, four adults and two children.  \n\nWe ordered our favorite the Fat Greek Combo, Zeus & Athena Beers and by recommendation from Jennica, the Greek Fries and  Flaming Feta, of course chicken tenders and spaghetti for the kids. The combo is huge, the fries indescribably delicious and just saying flaming feta makes my mouth water.  The kids...and adults loved the flaming presentation.\n\nJennica took very good care of us, the manager on duty even checked on our table and the owner Demetri stopped by too.  This staff obviously cares about the dining experience of their patrons!\n\nWe ate till our hearts and stomachs were content, who am I kidding, they were joyful!  And if that wasn't enough Jennica brought us out a dessert that was obviously created for a Greek God or at least a demigod or two. I'll do my best to describe in mortal words, vanilla ice cream sprinkled with cinnamon sat atop fried sweet bread with honey and whipped cream.  It was incredible.\n\nDefinitely sit on the patio and ask for Jennica, you won't be sorry.  Maybe a little stuffed, but not sorry at all!",201788

Not too often you can get a spot on Murray right near the place you're going to, so I took it as a sign.\n\nI'd been here before, the first time was late on a Sunday afternoon, when I walked in just about everything was sold out, I had my mouth watering for texas toast made with  Allegro's 12 grain whole wheat bread. Damn Like Seinfeld, someone ahead of me got the last loaf. I settled for a regular whole wheat. I really enjoyed it. \n\nThis time I was lucky and got the 12 grain I wanted.

5,"I absolutely love this place and truly wished I lived closer. I am a big fan of outdoor malls and there is something for almost everyone here. I say almost because there is only one store that my husband is interested in shopping in. But...this review is about me not him! ;) For me, I love the mix of more well-known clothing stores and local boutiques. I love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as Paradise Bakery, Chipotle, ColdStone Creamery, etc. In the summer, they have the misters going and in the winter, it is the fireplace. There is also a Harkins movie theater. Apart from the middle strip of shops, I like that I can hit up a Target, Ulta, BevMo in one stop. Who cares if I need to drive across the marketplace, the key thing is that I don't have to drive across town to find shops that are all in one place...so convenient. I don't get the parking complaints from other reviewers. How is that the fault of the marketplace? There is an over-abundance of parking spots, but it can be hard to find a spot due its popularity. If you are a bargain shopper, you can go to their website and print out coupons for its shops. My husband and daughter got BOGO frozen yogurt from Mojo Yogurt today. There is also a little splash pad in the middle of the shops that is great for the little ones. This is a great place to cover anything you might need.",290100
3,"3.5 Stars\n\nWhen I am building the perfect salad bar buffet in my mind, Sweet Tomatoes comes pretty close.  I understand that this is a chain and can not expect them to cater to my likes 100%.  As you walk in they have a few pre-made salads and in my made up place they would make your salad with the items you like and mix it along with your dressing selection in a bowl for you.  They have enough toppings to make your salad and a good variety of salad dressings.  They offer hot pasta items, muffins, bread, focaccia bread, soups, fruits and frozen yogurt.  I may have missed a few items but am painting a decent enough picture for the folks who never been to a Sweet Tomatoes.  I would like to see smaller batches of ingredients out on the salad bar with more frequent replenishment to ensure the freshest items are out all the time, again this is a item I would do in my made up salad bar.  The price is a bit high as well but usually are able to find coupons online to offset the cost a bit.",17806

I had it with steamed vegetables and clam chowder.  The clam chowder was also freshly made, and had nice large chunks of clam in it.  The chowder itself tasted a little too salty for me though.  The green beans were freshly steamed green beans, and they were a nice deep green color vs. the greyish mushy green beans you might usually see at restaurants.  \n\nService was excellent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Our waitress was very warm and friendly.  Sunny's Diner is hopefully here to stay for many years!",561819

4,"For LV this is a 4 star joint, as for the midwest, east coast, and south this is a 3 1/2 star. To become a 4 star elswhere I need a little more flavor and moist ribs. As a previous reviewer stated the pork ribs were a little dry. great beans, warning to light hearted these are spicy with a touch of jalapena, beef rib is moist tender and meaty. Ribs have just the right amount of mesq/hick smoke. Rib portions are proper, can stand alone w/o sauce, and well priced (avg $2.00 per bone). Not a fan of the potato salad to much mayo, not enough sugar and mustard. Bacon added to the potato salad is alright. If the ribs were taken off the grill 10mins earlier and just a little extra rub added before and after cooking, I would rate 5 stars LV and everwhere else.

2,"Claustrophobia galore! My boyfriend and I had reservations for his birthday and we were scared of hitting someone with the door! Raku is a small restaurant with tables so close to one another that it's not only  difficult to move around but it is challenging to have an intimate dinner with those you love. The portions and price ratio are somewhat outrageous! (Small, dinky portions and it costs a lot!) Can't say I was too pleased with my time here.\n\nIn my personal opinion, this place is overrated. My friend had glorified this place like no other and even the yelp ratings confirmed his love for this place. Unfortunately, I can't say the same :(. I expected this place to be so very close to how the yakitori places are in Japan. This place definitely falls short. \n\nDespite my disappointment, I must say, I was impressed by the quality and the menu. However, for the price and atmosphere, I don't see this as a worthy place to dine in. We ended up getting a few skewers of meat; I know we got the wagyu beef which definitely stood out, the tofu (the best thing I had on this menu) and grilled tako. No bueno on that grilled tako; I felt as if I was chewing on a rubber chicken that was burnt flavored. Blah! I honestly don't know why this place is highly rated; it's between \""good\"" and \""ok\"" but it isn't \""OMG this place is the s**t!\""\n\nI really tried to love this place. I tried to accept and tried to convince myself that I'm paying for high quality food, but seriously, this place is almost an insult. I had to stop at $85 worth of food because I wasn't sure how much I would need to spend to feel full and satisfied. I'm sad I wasted my hard earned money here and couldn't give my boyfriend an awesome birthday dinner. Vegas needs to step up their game on authentic yakitori places.\n\nPS. if you decide you want to go to Raku, I suggest not walking in as you are unlikely to get a table as a walk in. So make sure you try and get a reservation...",320859

Plenty of non burger choices too, delicious salads, yummy sandwiches and wonderful pastas. Awesome milkshakes, fries, sweet potato tots and pig wings (just try it).

Two groups were next to each other. The other group was across a walkway. We were fortunate to get the waiter who was probably new. He seemed to be a little panicked while the other waiter looked like he knew what he was doing. As for the group I was in, we had to wait a long time between ordering our drinks then ordering our food.

Not a lot of meat, and the curry was super greasy.  The pad thai was dry and tasted like it was anything but fresh.  My quest for GREAT thai food continues.

4,"Note: I only give out 5 stars to restaurants that are EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.\n\nOh, how I truly wish I could give Stick E Rice 5 stars! If I could grant this place 4.5 stars, I would quickly and happily do so. I spent the last few minutes debating this review with my wife, who is absolutely convinced that Stick E Rice deserves 5 stars.\n\nThis restaurant has several strong points. Their service is truly amazing. Every time I have come here, I have had the pleasure of being served by the same waitress, whose friendly greetings and smiles make me feel like a member of her family. The waitstaff is always on point, from timing courses well to clearing used dishes promptly. Drink refills are typically not an issue, unless you're only drinking water (but they never leave you wanting for a refill). The reason for this is that soft drinks are served ice cold in cans, accompanied by cold glasses filled with ice. I know that restaurants typically may profit more from serving soft drinks in cans, but I feel that better establishments provide fountain drinks with free refills.\n\nI ordered the potstickers as an appetizer, and they are VERY tasty and lack the excessive \""doughiness\"" served by so many other restaurants. I don't know if they're homemade, but I can tell you that surely you can't go wrong in placing an order for them.\n\nI typically order from the lunch special menu, so my meal is accompanied by a complimentary soup. The egg drop soup is tasty, and served in an attractive cup with a side of crispy chow mein \""chips.\"" I once had a rendition of the hot and sour soup, and I honestly have to say that it needs much work to resemble a true Chinese hot and sour soup.\n\nThe main courses are always flavorful. The portions may seem small, but upon finishing my order I am always very satisfied. The pepper steak, orange chicken, pad thai and mixed vegetable options are wonderful entrees. My wife's regular favorite entree is the \""mixed vegetables with added shrimp.\""\n\nYou simply must leave room for dessert!  Stick E Rice offers a dessert called \""Stick E Mango\"" that is absolutely a must-have! We order it every time we come here. Every time. The sticky rice is formed in sushi-sized pieces, and bear the almost banana-like sweetened flavor of coconut. Each order is seemingly bombarded with sliced mango! The mango has always been sweet and succulent; I have never had the unpleasantness of biting into a more green or hardened slice of mango. The mango is drizzled with a sweetened coconut \""caramel.\""\n\nI absolutely cannot fathom why anyone could possibly review Stick E Rice with less than a 3-star rating! Sure, the menu may not be perfectly Thai; this restaurant has more of a Thai-Chinese fusion offering, but this combination serves to offer its clientele more choices and even a more familiar option for the less brave. The menu is also somewhat customizable to personal taste and spiciness preference.\n\nTo maybe receive a 5-star rating:\n1. Serve fountain drinks with free refills. Even if free refills are not offered, at least, do not serve the soft drinks in cans! That's what I would expect at a home BBQ, not at a nicer restaurant. At a minimum, to preserve the appearance of \""freshness,\"" the soft drinks could be served in unopened, chilled glass bottles. I still prefer and strongly recommend the fountain drink option for cost effectiveness and \""friendliness\"" when serving very spicy food that may need to be frequently washed down.\n2. The restroom is very clean and spacious, but one must pass the register area and the doorway to the kitchen in order to access the restroom. I understand that this is a small business, but the area near the register should be kept clutter-free. I saw stacks of various papers, mail and other things which gave the appearance of an \""amateur\"" business. Clean that area up, especially if it's visible to clients. The kitchen is quite clean from what I could see. Then again, I shouldn't be able to see into the kitchen. Due to design limitations, a door is an unsafe option, but perhaps a sheer curtain or something may be put up to obscure the customer's view into the cooking area, and to somewhat muffle the noise coming from the kitchen into the dining area. I don't know what options are available, but that's not my job, is it?\n3. Move the music system to the back counter, out of sight.  At a minimum, hide the speaker wires or install some recessed or wireless speakers.\n4. Refine the menu more (i.e. hot and sour soup).",465375

Rather than just bring out a new sandwich the waiter came out and essentially blamed me and said the cook said that the egg was not cold.  Now I am irritated and ask to speak to the manager, a few minutes later, the so called executive chef comes out and continues to insult me.\n\nDon't waste your time with this restaurant, food is sub par the executive chef is clueless and the service is even worse.

I am not a big breakfast eater so it serves the purpose when I am in that particular mood.\n\nWhen I am traveling I often go to a MacDonald's for breakfast.

3,"Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\n\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \n\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.",869
2,"First things first, let's talk about the ONLY reason to (in my not so humble opinion) visit this restaurant...  Fried Chicken!  It's good.  No, It's really, really good.  If you need something tasty along with it, try the zucchini fries.  They're good, too and the dipping sauce is perfect.   \n\nAnd there ends my praise for the Fox.  Sadly, everything else I have tried on the menu has been bland, or just fallen short of my expectations.\n\nI've tried the catfish, the fried steak, the BLT, and several other things.  Everything tastes like they're out of seasoning.  After my last visit, I won't be back.  There's just too many other great options.  I would meet friends there if asked, and if so, I'd get the chicken.\n\nThe place is also pretty loud and the tables are crowded.  Service has never been an issue, the wait-staff is very nice.",542065
2,"I had been to this theater many times in the past but after a recent trip I had to ask myself, what happened? Over priced tickets for movies that have been out for several months, I do not think so. I went there with my nephew to see one of those Disney kid flicks and could not believe they had a huge line being handled by only 2 people. \n\nHere it is over 100 degrees and me waiting in line. So I decide to go inside and buy tickets from the ticket kiosk. Big mistake!! The machine did not work correctly and told me that it could not complete the transaction. So after speaking to a clueless manager who acted like I was wasting her time by asking for her help,  she goes and prints out two tickets. So before we headed into the movie we stopped to get a drink at the concession stand. Guess what? \n\nAnother big line with only one or two people working. So after paying 4 dollars for a drink and $3.50 for a small popcorn that was old and stale ( requested fresh popcorn) I made a quick stop at the bathroom. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. It was dirty, with paper towels on the ground and toilets that would not flush. \n\nTo top it all off later that evening I found out that I had been charged 100 dollars for two tickets!! Turns out the ticket machine put through the charge but would not print my tickets. When I called the theater they said it happens all the time. \nThey offered no solution to the problem and I had to spend three hours on the phone with the bank to get the charges reversed. If you want to see a film, hit the local red box or blockbuster video and pick up snacks from the dollar store. Cost of movie and candy $10. Not paying $100.00 to see Star Trek, priceless.",232419

1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I came into c&r tire on May 24, 2014 and replaced all 4 tires. I was never offered a warranty and the tire was damaged within 7 days and under 400 miles. The owner, Ralph, was extremely rude to me and actually expected me to pay for a new tire!! He claims I declined the road hazard warranty when it was never offered. I have been a discount tire customer for years and thought it was strange no warranty was offered at c&r. I know that they have an all new staff as the 79.91 cash(of the 429.91) I paid was never received(stolen by employee) and I was given a call within a few days asking me to come pay this amount again.

1,"\""AY. F'ING. CARAMBA. How can a dealer get 21 so many times!!!\"" Those were my exact thoughts about 4 shoes into the $5 black jack table at O'Sheas. Right around the time when I was reevaluating why I ever stepped foot into this tiny, cramped, stuffy joint instead of seeking out a giant alcoholic beverage.\n\nI know this sounds riidiculous but I swear the black jack here is rigged! 4-5 shoes and NO ONE at the completely full table was hitting any ounce of a winning streak. The dealer was hitting black jack, 21, and 20 like nobody's business. I swear it's something with that automatic shuffling device they got goin' on there! I'm on to you O'Sheas!\n\nAfter losing about 2 years of my life in extra-stuffy second hand smoke, and one very crappy daquiri later, I decided enough was enough and left this place about 40 bucks in the hole.

5,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was extremely attentive, the room felt luxurious enough to warrant the price (we were in the Tower, an upgrade we made at checkin for a very sweet deal). I loved the bathrobes and flirted with the idea of buying one until I saw the tag in the hotel store (200 dollars, alas).\n\nThe more secluded pool you get when you upgrade was very nice and not crowded, with prompt service by the extremely helpful eyecandy, I mean staff.\n\nOur room deal included tickets to Le Reve, which was incredible. If you have a chance to see it I highly recommend you do. Much better than O in my opinion, but in a similar vein, combining dance and gymnastics and diving, with artistry in the visual effects that is mind blowing.\n\nWe also ate at their breakfast buffet, at 10:45 which it turns out is a good time to go- you can eat both the breakfast and lunch menus as they transition over. The bottomless margaritas were a good deal, since we definitely got into the spirit of the \""bottomless\"" part.  I was very impressed at the variety of dishes, and how good they were considering it was a buffet. I'm trying to remember what we had, but the names of specific dishes seem to have been drowned in the sea of OJ and bubbly.\n\nThe casino did NOT smell like cigarette smoke, which is always a plus for me. We only saw it as we passed through, as we weren't there to gamble.\n\nSave up your $$$ and give it a try.",132428

I've been here 3 times so far:\n\nVisit #1 - 2 cars ahead of me - took about 10 minutes and I considered just driving away but decided to stick it through\nVisit #2 - 0 cars waiting so I was in and out in like 1 minute.  It was perfect.\nVisit #3 - 1 car ahead of me.  Took over 10 minutes so I drove away.\n\nWith that said my tip to you is this:  If there are any cars waiting then just drive away because you may be waiting there all day.\n\nI don't know if it is me or what, but I think waiting 10+ minutes for coffee is ridiculous.  This isn't Starbucks with 27 cars in line.  With just 1 or 2 cars this place grinds to a halt.  I don't know what the problem is.  My guess is that they offer 75 things on the menu.  Tons of coffee drinks, smoothies, sandwiches, etc.  They need to trim their offerings down 90% and only offer the basics to get people in and out ASAP.\n\nHopefully my Keurig will be fixed soon but this place comes in handy if there is nobody waiting or you have the patience of a saint.",549035

1,"This place leaves a lot to desired. My dad and I went during the week because he was craving Mexican food. So, I suggested we give Gil's a shot - trying to support local restaurants. \n\nIt was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren't deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). \n\nWe started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. \n\nThen, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. \n\nFor entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. \n\nThe 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's. \n\nAnd my rating is not because I'm comparing this place to normal \""Mexican food\"" places - I know this place is supposed to be \""New Mexican.\"" I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them.",371079
5,"Words cannot describe this show. Garth is amazing. His last tour ended in 1998 and since then he has stayed at home in Oklahoma raising his children. When his tour ended I was a little too young to be going to concerts. \nI had always said that there were only two reasons I'd ever go to Las Vegas. One was to see David Copperfield and the second was to see Garth Brooks if he ever came. Well, I saw David a couple years ago when he came to San Jose and last October I learned that Garth would be playing at Wynn. \nThe tickets are VERY hard to get. The first series of dates sold out in 5 hours. I was, unfortunately, not one of the lucky ones that got tickets that day. I did manage to get tickets earlier this month and planned the trip around my mom's birthday. \nIt was just Garth and his guitar up on stage. In this particular show that I went to he started out talking about what influenced him growing up and who his father and brothers were listening to.

2,"I'm a vegetarian and normally prefer hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants, but I was in Montreal, so wanted to eat French. But I know French food is not generally vegetarian friendly, so searched for one that was and chose this one for that reason and because folks seem to love it. But I didn't. \n\nI started with a tomato salad, the only non-meat appetizer of any sort. It was pretty good, especially the herbs sprinkled throughout, but they served it on a small cutting board for some reason, which was just plain stupid. I had to try extra hard not to have it fall into my lap or get balsamic vinegar everywhere.\n\nThere were three vegetarian entrees -- a pasta, a vegetable plate, and a tomato tart. The tart sounded most interesting and French, so I ordered that. It took forever to come and when it did it looked like some poorly executed \""artisinal\"" pizza you'd get at a mall Italian restaurant trying to go uptown. It tasted better than that, but not by much. It wasn't a tart as I'd define one. It was a piece of poorly done crust, with some tomatoes and cheese, and a few greens, thrown on top, and probably put in the broiler for a minute.\n\nShortly before my tart came, the restaurant sat another couple right beside me with only about a foot separating our tables even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It made the rest of the night uncomfortable for me as a solo diner. I doubt the couple liked it either. When I finished my meal, I asked for my check, waited forever, read about 20 pages of a book without anyone paying any attention to me, and then had to flag someone down to ask again.\n\nThe music -- early Stones and T-Rex -- was the best part of the restaurant, which is pretty sad.",371131

2,"Upon my recent stay, I was disappointed that the night manager upon check-in did not honor my marquis suite upgrade for a discounted rate when booked months prior to my stay. He charged me the full amount for a room upgrade and reasoning was because the hotel had less then 10 rooms available the day of check-in despite all the marquis suite's being unbooked. When I spoke to the day manager the next day, he pretty much hinted that the hotel didn't want to honor their room upgrade and wanted more money. Why offer a discounted upgrade in the first place.

1,"Can I give negative stars? \nMy boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said \""here's your check please pay and leave.\"" I said \""Excuse me\"" and he responded \""You are a waste of space at my bar.\"" I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded \""are you serious?\"" All he said was \""Leave\"" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, \""Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway.\"" As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said \""I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!\"" WHAT!!!!!!

Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?!

2,"Wanted to like this, but no. For a bit of background, my husband is half Lebanese and we've eaten our fair share of Middle Eastern food of all stripes and varieties. For really good Middle Eastern food in that part of the city, try Fatoush. Little hole in the wall run by an Iraqi man (I think).\n\nAnyways, this place. Honestly the only reason it gets 2 stars is because hubby liked several of the dishes that I didn't try, like the kafta. First of all, when we ordered water to go with the meal, they brought us bottled water and then charged us for it. EVERY other restaurant I've ever been to in my life has either correctly assumed that I wanted a glass of water, or asked me to clarify whether I wanted bottled water or not. When the waitress turned up a few minutes later, we asked for glasses of water. After she conferred with someone in the back, we got glasses of lukewarm tap water- with no ice.\n\nAnd then, the food. Granted, at a Mediterranean buffet, I expect mostly Mediterranean food, but here even that was too much to ask. Of the four buffet tables full of food, maybe one and a half was food I would have considered Mediterranean, and even some of that was a stretch. Some of the dishes in the buffet included: lasagna (looked frozen), alfredo (gummy and bland), pasta with chicken (just strange), zucchini fries (obviously frozen), fried okra (?), spring rolls (frozen), orange Jell-o squares (huh?). The rice pilaf was too salty and had Jalapeno peppers in it(?). As for the actual Mediterranean food, the stuffed grape leaves were the best of the bunch. As I mentioned, hubby liked the kafta but it was a bit spicy for me. The hummus was bitter- too much tahini. The chicken schwarma tasted like someone tried to alter a recipe for chicken parmesan. Really, the best section overall was the salads. The tabbouleh was decent although it needed more salt to counteract all of the lemon juice. And one other salad had huge chunks of feta cheese in it- the feta was strong and flavorful.\n\nOverall, there is NO way I'd go back here, even with another Groupon.",559626

5,"Two Words: absolutely delicious.\n\nThis place is chock-full of character. It's a great escape from a horrendous workday. I've never been to France but the vibe here feels French cafe-esque. The owner, who is French, is also the cashier and he is a total charmer. Plus he is happy to help you out with your order should you have any questions. Sometimes I just ask him questions I know the answer to just to hear his accent. I know I know....\nAnd It's also a family owned\\run restaurant so that also adds some warm and fuzzies to the experience.\n\nI've been here twice (soon to be 3x because I want to go back tomorrow).\nBoth times I ordered the chipotle sandwich and both times I considered licking every crumb and drop of sauce off my plate. I could say it was the flavor combination. I could say it was due to the incredible chipotle sauce and fresh avocados. I could also say that it was the fresh & crisp baguette it came on. I'll just say it was all of the above.\n\nI ordered a cup of the cream of celery soup today. I don't even like celery all that much, but I had heard the owner\\cashier describe it to the guy in front of me and I was sold. My only regret was I didn't order a bowl.... or a gallon. There was a distinct essence of  fresh celery in the soup but somehow, maybe magically, the creaminess mixed in with the freshness made this the best cup of soup I can remember. Apparently I do like celery.\n\nBoth times I ordered a coffee beverage. For the coffee snobs out there, myself included, they serve Illy coffee. For the non-coffee snobs -- this is AWESOME coffee. First time was drip coffee the 2nd was an iced white mocha.... both yummy.\n\nSo for a half sandwich, a cup of soup, and medium iced white mocha totals just 12 bucks..... a small price to pay for perfection, I'd say. Baguette Cafe is a jewel of a lunch joint. If I didn't work in the area, I'd find an excuse to drive across town just to enjoy it.\n\nRun don't walk to this place.

1,Ordered delivery Pizza was disgusting. Hot wings were disgusting. Price was outrageous in comparison to the quality. Cookie desert burn on the outside undercooked on the inside. Idiot driver placed ice cream over hot cookie so it was liquid by the time it got to us. Shouldn't have even delivered that desert.,59510
3,You get a free birthday drank if you sign up for it a bit ahead of your birthday! It's pretty awesome. But this is your average run of the mill Starbucks. Nothing special!,76772
2,"This place was a Mega Cafe, a Coco's and Mi Tierra, prior to becoming Fiesta Chips and Salsa.\n\nI don't think they will be around long, Mi Tierra had much better food, at much more reasonable prices. Mi Tierra charged $7.50, including taxes, for a beef chimichanga, sides of rice and beans, with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo on the side, with iced tea. Chips and Salsa charged $12.00, including taxes, for a burrito with a little shedded lettuce and a small slice of tomato on the side, with iced tea. As I said, if Mi Tierra, selling better food at lower prices, went out of business, I don't thinks Chips and Salsa stands a chance,\n\nThat being said on with the Yelp:\n\nThey start you off with chips and salsa, no surprise there. However, you would think with the name Chips and Salsa, they would have good chips and salsa, they don't. The chips were cooked wrong, they were cooked at too low a temperature for too long. The result was over cooked, on the edge of burnt, oily chips. The chips were so oily, they were shiny, as if someone poured oil over them. The salsa was okay, nothing to write home about. With salsa in their name, you might think they would have brought a variety of salsas for the chips, (Mi Tierra brought two kinds of salsa and bean dip to go with the chips, while you were deciding on what to order and while they prepared it.).\n\nI had a Grande Meat Burrito (carne asada), it was okay,  Carne asada, rice, cheese, beans and pico de gallo, in a flour tortilla, though I didn't notice any cheese. It was not served with any sauces, I would think a place with salsa in it's name would want to showcase their salsas, guess not. Although size is relative, the grande burrito was closer to medio, than grande.\n\nWhile there I heard several complaints from people, on the lines of \"" there's suppose to be guacamole served with this\"" or \"" I specifically ordered this with the sauce on the side, they put the sauce on it and tried to scrape it off'\"". So apparently the kitchen doesn't know what's on their menu or how it's served and have trouble with simple requests. I assume the servers corrected the mistakes, but it's always more impressive to get it right in the first place. As near as I can tell, I got what I ordered, so it appears I was lucky. The server checked to see if I needed anything else, refilled my tea, etc. so I have no problem with the service side. I gave an extra star for the server, a girl with dark red hair, or they would have gotten a one star.\n\nThere are too many good Mexican restaurants in town, to settle for what they offer at this one. I won't be back.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAngie M.commented, \""hey wen did u went to fiseta and chips salsa and wht time   u should talked to the main manger \"" [sic]\n\nIn my response to Angie, I took the time to translate into English, corrected the spelling of fiesta, corrected the business name and answered her questions.\n\nQue lastima (what a shame), this may account for the mistakes people were having with their orders.",639622
4,"FIrst experience there was great!  No reservation, but got us right in and the service was fantastic.  Food was as wonderful as expected from our experiences at the chef's former restaraunt and a pretty good variety for many types of diets.  Preview of the upstairs \""private club\"" is interesting.  Will look forward to checking that out when it's ready!",498769
2,"For all the hype this place did not live up to my expectations. The service was good but the kitchen clearly lost our order as the table that was seated 20 minutes after us received their entrees before we did (both tables ordered sandwiches). In the end the wait was not worth it as I only finished half my sandwich and fries. There are excellent places to eat in Vegas, however this is not one of them.",461199
1,The last few times being in that store I've noticed that the manager Temple is very rude to his employees and he even had an elderly lady help with his put downs on a young man working there. So disappointing that an adult is willing to put down his employees!!,247896
3,"Mmmmm.  Popcorn.  Many, many flavors of popcorn.  Sweet, savory.  Chocolate, nuts.  Buttery, salty.  All of it.  And MPK does it well.  I love that they offer mini bags ranging from $2-$6.  Forced portion control.  If I was given a barrel of popcorn, I would somehow manage to get it down.\n\nSo why only 3 stars?  Less than impressive customer service.  Now the lady at the front (owner?) is great.  Very helpful and friendly.  The girls in the back...not so great.  I was in before Christmas to buy 13 mini bags...all different.  Although there were numerous people in the back, there seemed to be more socializing than actual work going on.  It took a good 20 minutes or so to get my order ready.  I could have eaten the product faster than they packed it.  No worries.  The shop is fun to browse.  But when my order was finally ready and I was heading out the door, an employee came out with a bag that they had missed.  At this point, I knew they probably did not bother to double check my order, so I did it when I got to my car.  Even with the bag they missed, I was still missing one...a $6 bag at that.\n\nAgain, the lady at the front was very apologetic, but the gal working in the back was argumentative as she \""knew\"" she had packed that particular flavor.  She came out front to get my entire bag, so that she could go through it herself and see what was missed.  Apparently, I am both a liar, illiterate, and unable to count to 13.  So now I'm waiting again with nothing to do but wonder why they didn't do this before they gave me the order.  Finally, she was sufficiently convinced the missing bag was, indeed, missing.  Upon returning my order, she remarked it had been packed, but not given to me.\n\nI still might not have dropped my rating if not for the fact that while I was waiting for the sleuth in the back to solve her case, another customer came in complaining that she was missing 5 bags of her 20 bag order.  Unfortunately for her, the order was for an office function that had already taken place.\n\nSo moral of my long-winded review is to give MPK a shot if you're a popcorn lover, but make sure you check your order before you leave.  They won't.",563189

With all due respect to you your family and your establishment God bless you Larry keep keeping the food coming out good just get rid of this guy ASAP he will ruin your restaurant!

I won't eat a pub burger out anywhere but here. The duck fat fries are amazing. If you are afraid of gravies ask for it on the side.I recommend everything on the menu. If you would eat it somewhere else, try it here. The food is like something you would dream came from a french countryside home, butchered out back and cooked in a big old black iron skillet. I just ate, but know I'm hungry again. ;)",409137

3,"I've been to Vegas enough times to be bored with the basics (drink, gamble, try to pick up some girl out of my league), so I was excited to hear of different things to do in town.\n\nWith our group of 7, I'd hoped we'd play some private games, but this place has larger games than what i'm used to. You probably need to pay a lot of money to get some private games.\n\nThe melee style game got old real quick. I'm a bigger fan of the team game which is similar to capture the flag. The attendant there said that they only play team games during the overnight kid parties.\n\nI have no interest in having a slumber party with a bunch 12 year olds just so I can play my favorite style of laser tag, that's just me.\n\nThe suits are alright, the course is compact but with lots of hidey places and mirrors to bounce off of, but like I said, the game just gets boring If you're just running around shooting.\n\nScrew the stupid tweens who walk behind you and keep shooting you after your suit gets active again.\n\nTranq darts might be a good thing to use - it's dark inside and no one'll see you knock the annoying kid out.",70504

It is a sports book bar, so it can get crazy during games. Not the quieter, serious gamers only experience! \nService is hit or miss, which shouldn't be the case. Often, they don't have enough staff during busy times. But, staff is usually quite friendly. There's lot of seating throughout the sports book, and one nicer area has comfy big red chairs. A good spot to enjoy a 99 cent margarita, which is only served at the Sports Book!",515249
2,"Food was excellent. Price is high but not overpriced. Presentation was outstanding. \n\nWines were in fact overpriced. A restaurant of this quality should know better than to serve a bottle of wine that Harris Teeter carries for 20 and try and sell for 45. A bottle of Merlot for 40??? It's merlot! Come on guys get your act together!\n\nService was very good once we we actually waited on. 7 minutes from the time we sat down. There were only 2 tables in the place that had customers. No excuse for that! \nThe decor was great, the only complaint would be the floors were so sick my chair was constantly sliding thought the night. Very odd that a place would miss out on a detail like that. \n\n\nOverall for $100 for 2 there are too many other choices in Charlotte.",537602

4,"I am far from expert in this field of  sushi but I've tried a fair amount at a fair number of places, and I thought this was exceptional. I already liked the Korean food at the predecessor C J B Korean establishment and now I have a new favorite place for sushi as well.  \n\nBlack suspended tile ceilings with dark concrete floors, walls of bright green and some modern oriental art in between. Slightly spare, clean, modern feel to the place.  Men's room was spotlessly clean, modern with up to date fixtures, stocked with all the necessities. \n\nOur young server was friendly and attentive and our water glasses never went dry - except when I bumblingly knocked mine over, which was taken in stride by staff, and quickly replaced with a fresh glass. Service, from being seated, to order taking, to delivery food, to delivery of the check, involved no undue delays.  In fact, as Norm R noted,  service was almost too efficient as servers were anxious to whisk away our plates almost before we cleared them, but I'll take that over that experienced by another reviewer any day.\n\nNow as to the FOOD, Excellent in every way.  Beautifully presented, multiple distinct flavors. Best shumai ever tasted. Tongue tantalizing tuna tataki, rich, red, flavorful, and our accidental order, the \""OhYa I Forgot\"", was a definite \""no regrets\"", the closest thing to a dessert sushi I've ever encountered with its touch of peach.  \n\nAnd finally, we didn't go away hungry, indeed as one should not from a $65 + tip meal for two, but you need not spend nearly so much.  There are considerably reduced happy hour prices and several \""chef's surprise\"" samplers at under $20. \n\nThe service we received was \""comfortable\"", perhaps more friendly than polished, and that's just fine by me.  I highly recommend with the hope the service you receive is as good as we got, and not the indifference experienced by another recent reviewer below.",234123
4,I am commenting on the super Bi-lo in Matthews on Fincher Farm lane.  The managers and sales staff are quite friendly and do go out of their way to assist you. They recently overcharged me on an item that was still advertised as buy one get one free but they made good and refunded all the  money plus I got to keep the item. Can't complain about that. I wish they did offer more gourmet items as Harris Teeter does but I like the shopping experience there and they do have good deals on lots of items that I buy frequently. That is why I keep going back.,420184
1,"I was in town for a national healthcare related conference hosted at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I had never been to Las Vegas before this, nor have I ever gambled. I flew in a day early and stayed at a Marriott in Henderson. I spent the next day hiking to the Hoover Dam and some nearby mountains.\n\nI had a rental car. For a first-timer, the Strip is a little daunting. After some maneuvering, I found Caesar's Palace. I didn't know they had free valet service and wouldn't you know it, the free parking garage is a loooong walk from the check-in desk. \n\nWhen I checked in I made a grave mistake that only someone who has never been to Vegas makes. I didn't tip the registration person before I checked in. This guaranteed me the worst room available at that time. I hadn't done enough homework on the nuances of Vegas. I would be paying for my initial error many times over again during my stay.\n\nI asked if there was a cart I could use to haul my week's worth of clothing and tradeshow materials to my room. I was curtly told that wasn't possible, but I could employ a staff member to do it for me. I declined. Even though it was going to be an ordeal to carry all of it through the floor of the casino, I could physically handle it. I was in the Roman Towers. It took three trips.\n\nAfter I checked in the room, I took a shower. The room itself was a nice size. I had a view of an interior courtyard rooftop. There was no door on the bathroom. There was a handset phone next to the toilet, more antiquated than quaint.\n\nA small TV screen was next to one of the sinks. The bath tub was large and in-charge. \n\nI went downstairs and signed up to get a player's club. I also signed in on FourSquare and was given a free buffet at Lagos as a special. \n\nI told them I had never gambled before and they took their time answering my questions. You can't buy chips with a credit card, but there are ATM machines all around that take plastic. You don't even need to know your pin number (you just pay a higher fee).\nI had set my limit at $100. When I withdrew it, I got a hundred dollar bill (instead of 20s). Next to the ATM is a machine which will turn your $100 bills into smaller denominations. \n\nI found a helpful young lady at the small concession stand near the parking lot elevator who gave me a map of the facility.\n\nI had dinner at the Noodle restaurant by the lobby elevator. The d\u00e9cor is a shocking white pattern with mirrors reflecting light into your eyeballs which still maybe adjusting from the dimness of the casino floor. They had massive fish tanks filled with thousands of goldfish.\n\nThe beer that says draft on the menu is not what we in America consider a draft. It was a weak beer in a bottle and draft was the brand. The noodle dish was okay, but average isn't what I want from Vegas dining, not at the price for my dinner.\n\nAll night I was roused through vigorous banging on the hotel wall at random times. Several thumps were hard enough to shake my bed. In the morning there was no cold water in the shower. Thankfully the bathtub had a hand-held shower extension and I could bathe there. That was the only morning that the shower's cold water didn't work.\n\nI discovered my room shared a wall with the servant's elevator and work room. That is what had made the noises the night before (and every night at random times during my entire stay).\n\nI ate each morning at Lagos and each time, it was excellent (except the last day). They have two lines. If you are a diamond or seven club member, there is no waiting. Otherwise, come at the wrong time, and the line looks like a crowd waiting for a Disney ride. I arrived early enough (8AM) each day that there was no line. Typically by the time I left, folks were accumulating, much more so on the weekend.\n\nThey had wonderful lox, capers and other delights. The waitstaff, almost to a fault, was exceedingly attentive. The only negative experience was when I asked to see if my friend had arrived before I did for our meal. I was told to look from the door but was discouraged from entering to see if he was indeed there.\n\nOn our last morning, the buffet had turned from being breakfast into being a 'brunch'. What that meant for us much greater cost and almost none of the good food we'd been enjoying all week. Lox were gone, and most of the regular breakfast items were either low or out. \n\nAnother friend of mine who arrived separately was incredulous that we didn't know the tip rule. He had the same level of room reserved as we did (same conference) and tipped the front desk $50 on check-in. He was given a palatial, presidential suite. \n\nYou can smoke in Vegas casinos. I don't mind second hand smoke, so it didn't bother me.\n\nThe TV doesn't get many channels other than Caesar/Las Vegas promos/Asian ones. The internet is woeful and expensive, but I didn't expect anything else. I brought my Sprint hotspot and was getting 4G almost everywhere.\n\nThe pool is nice, but randomly, private parties bar all but diamond/7 stars.",236454
3,If the staff isn't over flooded with orders the food and service is fine. If they are busy they ignore call in orders and the burritos kinda of suffer.,244248
5,"I'm visiting from LA, where we may have a good sushi place or two.  But I found this restaurant on Yelp, and off I went, thinking I'd look more toward meat items, as I'd eaten at another sushi restaurant the night before.  When I pulled up to the restaurant, admittedly I was a bit worried, because the signage made me think cookie cutter strip mall Japanese restaurant.  (Usually, when I think Japanese restaurant in a strip mall, I feel more comfortable if it looks like a dive.)  But generic outside appearance aside, this restaurant holds its own with some of the top restaurants of its kind in LA, and brought to mind restaurants like Wa and the original Katsu-ya.  I began with a house specialty, yellowtail sashimi with just enough tempura jalapeno in a garlic and yuzu-based sauce, before moving on to beef tataki, seared to a beautiful texture with a garlic chili oil.  Both were delicious and perfectly tender.  From there, the chef came out--it was wonderful to get such personal attention (and the restaurant was quite busy)--and we discussed what I might want next.  He suggested I try a white sea bass he had just gotten in, and then a trio of taro tostadas, each a combination of a different fish, spice (as in heat) and avocado cream.  They were fabulous small bites.  I finished my meal with the signature miso marinated black cod, perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful, accompanied with a yuzu-based vinaigrette that complemented it perfectly.\n\nMy primary server was quite attentive and personable (as were all the others), the setting is unpretentious and comfortable, and I didn't know until the end that Chef had graciously given me the white sea bass and tostada tastings.  That was just the cherry on top of an exceptional meal.  It won't be the cheapest Japanese meal you've ever had (though the prices are very fair for what you get, and there are good deals to be had at happy hour and lunch), and if you're a quantity over quality person, there are probably better choices, but if you appreciate top quality, extremely fresh ingredients handled deftly by a talented chef, this is your restaurant.  Even if it were in LA, Soho would still be a standout.  Next time I'm in Vegas, this will be at the top of my list.",620164

3,"This restaurant is really cool...worth visiting just to see the setting/decor. If you are inside the Caesar Palace or in the vicinity and want chinese food, go to this place instead of the chinese place at the Forum food court. The food is pretty good. The specialty item is the handpull noodle with different topping, with the pork/mushroom as being the most popular. I did try that and was happy with it. I do eat in the San Gabriel valley a lot and I think this place is pretty good. The food cost anywhere from $9-$30 per dish, which is still cheaper than any other sit down chinese restaurants at the Bellagio, The Aria, or the Wynn. Red 8 at the Wynn is probably the best casual asian/chinese in the casino though.",369195
3,"Decent food we went for breakfast but I was told i could order off the lunch menu. I tried the chicken sandwich with sliced apples the sandwich was good bread was fresh.

Nothing out of this world I have to say but goof to grab a quick salad, or sandwich and sit outside to people watch.

I want them to be successful so we will certainly give them another chance.\n\nSo we went the next night with other friends.  Like I said, we really want this restaurant to be successful.  Service was somewhat better, course we had the attention of the manager.  Still got some things to work out...its slow and forgetful.  The food is quite good.  We sat on the patio which is great.  As we were leaving about 8:30 - 3 bus loads of ASU college students were arriving.  OMG!.  They are not prepared for that kind of crowd yet.  I'm sure they had a good time anyway.\n\nI'm upgrading my rating to 4stars.  I've been there 5 times and each time service gets better and better.  Food is always very good. My husband had a pork chop that was heaven on earth.  It's not on the menu any more but ask.  Drinks are now coming quickly and they haven't forgotten anything (ok except for the apples on the apple Gorgonzola salad which was more hysterical than anything) in the last 2 visits.

However, otherwise, you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan label that lacks flavor.

We were greeted by a uppity hostess ..who acted like we could not be seated or taken care of..I understand --we DID NOT have a reservation, but it was a Tuesday Night and it was 6 PM and No one was there....no one other than myself and the waiters. She did say she would try and I went to the restroom and came back out and she ..said..POSSIBLY we could sit at the bar...So we took it..a party of three...and we were happy to be there--it just sets the mood when the people that own the restaurant where YOU are going to spend YOUR MONEY and they act indifferent to you..\nWe started out with a bottle of BOOM BOOM Sirah..it was good. We ordered 3 appetizers...the Mediterranean Lamb, the Berkshire Pork Belly, and Butternut Squash  Soup.   Soup was good..Pork Belly can do no wrong..EVER and the Lamb...not quite good and way to tough and well done.\nWe then ordered the Sea Bass and the Open Raviolio. The Open Raviolio had way to much canned tomatoes, zucchini and wet veggies...not really there. The Sea Bass looked beautiful..the top 1/2 inch was edible the rest..was a tough gelatinous piece of sea carcass. NOT able to cut or eat.

1,"Is there a way to give negative stars?  We chose this place because it seemed like a nice quiet place to chill and talk.  At first, that's exactly what we got.  Our server was pleasant and quick with the drinks.  She left about 15 minutes after we sat down, however, and things turned awful.\n\nWe were harassed by 3 different homeless people for money.  Granted, it's not Fitzgerald's fault that homeless people come up to people sitting on their patio. However, they didn't take an active role in getting the homeless people to leave until one actually went into the bar.  They care about themselves not being bothered and not the customers sitting on the patio.\n\nAround 1am we were told it was last call and asked by a bartender if we wanted another drink.  By 1:10 our tabs were all closed but we remained on the patio talking and finishing our last call drinks. As with all drinking, we took turns going into the bar to use the restroom.  At 1:30am we were told that we couldn't go in and out of the bar (even to use the restroom).  At 1:45 we were told by a bartender that the bar closes at 1:30 and the sign in the window and google (which both say the bar closes at 2am) haven't been right \""for a long time.\"" The entire time this was going on, the bartenders were sitting inside at the bar with a \""friend\"" watching us.

At 1:55am they apparently got sick of waiting for us to leave and we watched as the bartenders ran up the street with the friend they were sitting at the bar with to make last call at another bar (which they told us they wanted to do earlier in the night).  The staff here do not care about this place or the perception their actions leave with the customers.  I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out $100 bills with every beer (which was only slightly above room temperature btw). There are far too many better options uptown to waste your time at a place that does not care about your business.",540816
3,"Frederico Fellini was a brillant and enigmatic Italian director of films in the 50's, 60's and 70's. 4 of his films won an Oscar for best foreign film.\nIf you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . \n\nHis movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. \n\nHe is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.\n\nThis Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. \n\nThe Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.\n\nService was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. \n\nInside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film. For something more like that, just step back out onto the Strip!",286905

1,"BIRTHDAY FOR HUBBY UGH\nFirst of all I booked this on Priceline, I booked a room with a separate living space. It did not happen that way at checkin. WE WERE actually given a standard room.\n\nWe also called the hotel directly on May 10th, to verify the bedding would be hypo allergenic (no goose or down at all), I requested a fridge for a medical need, and a baby crib too. I was also promised a beech credit of 50. I recorded the call to verify all was ready to go.\n\nWe selected the M BAY for the pools, shark reef exhibit, and the it being on the end of the strip, with the boys. \n\nWhen we arrived it took one hour and thirty minutes to check in. No help with our bags. After the checking in the issues and more concerns piled up, only to not be resolved in a timely manor, or only after asking for the same item more than once. If it even was resolved at all.\n\n\nThe standard room, was dirty.\n1. Hair on bed and pillows.\n2. Toilet had number 2 stains in it.\n3. Snack tray was there, but item was open gross I am hoping no charge for that.\n4. Wrong bedding\n5. there was no way I was going to stay in the wrong room either.  I spoke to the main desk. who promised us help quickly. \nWe Waited for the agent we spoke to to come move us he did not?\n6. We called guest services again and then were told to hold by Rachel. She spoke To agent one and said he actually would not move us right away and that the wait was not too bad, and then stated the first agent had to get permission from the supervisor to help us. However he did not and was unable to call us back in the whole forty minutes we waited.\n3. All of a sudden the crib shows up, and he tries to put it in the room. Unfortunately that is when I called back to the desk, as we were moving rooms or so I thought. \n\nTHE SECOND ROOM WAS WORSE.\n1. The view was nice, but that's all.\n2. It was still the wrong room, as it had no king and no separate bed for the kids, no living space, and no baby crib, or fridge, \n3. Dirty headboard with white fluid on it? I have the pictures. The room smelled like smoke, and would have to wait for bedding to be changed. \n4. Called and spoke to The only assistant night manager, who was awful his name was TREA, (Trey).\n\nHE WANTED TO JUST HAVE US WAIT IN THE FILTH AND HAVE A MAID EVENTUALLY CLEAN THE ROOM. I WAS NOT ABLE TO ALLOW THAT WITH OUR  KIDS AND US. THE ROOM WAS REALLY NOT CLEAN AND WAS IN ITS OWN RIGHT A HEALTH HAZARD. WE WERE EVEN TOLD TO STORE MEDS IN MINI BAR.\n\n\nANOTHER ISSUE, we took our bags to the bell desk as the assistance never came to the room to help load them. I was so upset I ended up talking to TK as I refused to talk to TREA. He had us store our bags at the bell desk.We then had to leave our bags at the bell desk while again they tried to fix the room cleanliness issue, and get us into the correct the room. I brought down my iPad to guest services and showed TK the booking to make sure it would run smoothly. He said it would be correct and that the crib and fridge would be in the room and cold when we got back. The only thing is we would have to have call down for our luggage when we get back to the room later. All of this took at least another hour and a half if not more.\n\nROOM THREE - WORSE YET AFTER RETURNING AT TEN AT NIGHT, \nwe came back to the room only to be shocked by just a king bed. where does my older son sleep!  Where does the baby sleep. \n\n NO BABY CRIB NO FRIDGE. WE HAD JUST REPLACED THE MEDS FROM CVS.  Which one expensive fix. It was still the wrong room. I called down to guest services again, and was told they can't get another room right now, but could get us or correct room tomorrow. They left us in a jam and we were forced to take the room as is. Tub was dirty too. The baby crib did not show up after three calls and closer to midnight, and the rollaway bed that was promised for our older son never came. The fridge came before the baby crib at 11:39 PM. I was very upset at this point. \nAs soon as the baby bed came, everyone crashed. My poor husband in a chair as we did not have enough beds for us. A great way to spend his birthday trip sleeping, waiting and asking for help with issues. \n\nTHE FORTH ROOM, \nFINALY THE CORRECT ROOM, MY HUSBAND HIMSELF MOVED US IN WITH WHAT HE COULD CARRY AND WAITED FOR THE REST OF OUR LUGAGE TO ARRIVE. he waited forty minutes. The fridge never came, the baby bed had to asked about two times, but the room was right. Crappy view beyond what vegas should have, literally faces another wall, and when you look down there is a ton of pipes and bird poop. AGAIN I HAVE A PICTURE. \n\n\nHERE IS WHAT WE WRE PROVIDED\n\nCRAPPY FLOOR SERVICE WHILE AT THE CASINO, got one drink in two hours plus.\n\nA SHARK REEF VISIT ON THEM, AND a 100 dollar credit. We also requested a late check-out do to our super late check-in and all the room changes. \n\nIT IS NOT WORTH IT TO STAY HERE. I WOULD RATHER GO TO THE RIO, or the hard rock.\n\nWE want is a complete refund of time, to book someplace else without stress. \nLOVE RIO!",171953
3,"I have pretty much come to the conclusion that these wings are the fast food of wings. Not that they try to present themselves otherwise but I just get a very generic feel from these wings.\n\nI will say that the service at this location is top notch. The cashier taking orders was very nice and made sure to clarify what I had ordered before she put the order in. I ordered three chicken strips with original hot sauce and fries with a side of cheese sauce. The strips were just okay. I would not go out of my way to order them again. The fries were the same. The cheese sauce that came with them was overall pretty bland. My true issue lies with the amount of salt that is used in everything here. Way too much salt. It became overpowering halfway through my meal. As one of the other reviewers said, I could also taste sugar in the fries which is just completely unnecessary. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back to Wing Stop. There are certainly many other better alternatives for wings in the area. I might consider trying something else here but not any time soon.",627349
4,"I've always liked stopping in at the Bottleshop. As for beer, their selection is hard to beat. And I have to say, I think the prices are pretty reasonable when you consider the selection carried.\n\nTheir food is pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. I would say it's a step above your average \""bar food\"" menu, but it definitely isn't gourmet either. But with that being said, you get a good meal for what you pay for. I've never really been disappointed, just don't go expecting to rave about the food. But I've never complained about it either!",357545
5,"Perfect breakfast spot! Delicious food and quick excellent service. Super friendly :) as soon as you walk it's a homey feeling from the get go. \n\nWe got the western omelette, waffles, pancakes, and meat lovers omelette. Everything was fantastic.

1,"I came to test-drive a car and all of the questions I asked the salesman read the answers directly off the sticker. Since I am a literate person, that wasn't necessary nor was it relevant as the questions I had about the vehicle didn't have answers that could have been found on the sticker. Yeah, I do my own research before I waltz into these places and when I ask questions I expect my \""expert\"" sales guy to answer them as he is supposed to know what he's selling, right?\nI had to leave. \nThe next day, Salesguy Einstein called me. And then a few days later. And again, a few days after that. I'll give him that for at least being persistent. But he thought the price was the problem - not the car itself, which I decided I didn't like anymore after I drove it, and he was leaving me these ridiculous messages about selling me a \""used Mercedes.\"" It was all really annoying and embarrassing to listen to.",548439
3,not bad. i like that you can order online and set up the time you want to pick up your food. i had the thai coconut curry and pot stickers. the food was good. obviously its not the most authentic but do you really expect authentic at a place like this? not really. all in all i'm a fan. i'll be back.,247583
1,"The restaurant seemed nice at first appearance.  Appetizer -chicken potstickers were great.  The bowl size  wasn't too big. It was $9.99 a bowl  (dinner)and make bottom less bowl  ( repeat bowls) was another 4 dollars.  Not  a lot once cooked.  Could have cooked a little longer as broccoli was still completely hard and not even warm.   And the initial bowl is small.  For family of 4, it was expensive  for amount of food.  I was very excited for the restaurant to open up,  but overall  disappointed.  Felt like we rush thru the  entire process and  rushing us out the door.  Won't go again",606474

3,"What a treat!  This Western themed restaurant is as hokey as it gets.  We went to Rustler's Rooste for a rehearsal dinner and the set-up outside was pretty cool with city views.  Between the rattlesnake appetizers, fried shrimp, bbq chicken and the many libations, we had good time.  The food was only mediocre, but the service was good and the tourist nature of the spot was entertaining.\n\nOne plus for the family folks is that kids...LOTS of kids are welcome.  There is a fenced-in bull when you walk in and a slide with lots of screaming kiddos.  The prices are a little steep for the quality but it is a tourist trap, so be prepared.",31804
3,"We like this place better than the rest of the chain, boring, mediocre Mexican food joints such as El Torito, Macayo's, Manuel's, Gardunos, or Garcias. The portions are generous, the food seems fresher and more colorful than these other \""Americanised\"" Mexican places. Good service too. The chicken quesadilla is great, and their nachos are served as individual chips piled with meat and cheese on them, sort of unique. Like I said, this is the best of the chains, but its not authentic Mexican food at all!",324537
3,"I've biked past Union Grill countless times as its $10 wine list sign blinks tauntingly but never stopped until recently.\n\nBesides the $10 wine list (yes, Union Grill has about 8+ different bottles of wine to choose from all for $10), Union Grill is known for its burgers. \n\nThese half-pound burgers are made from dry-aged ribeye, sirloin, brisket and chuck, which are then ground into a burger. Burgers are accompanied by lettuce, tomato, onions, and a dill pickle and served with your choice of cole slaw, waffle fries, sweet potato chips, vegetable of the day, or rosted garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nEven though the Five-hour Pot Roast was so very tempting, I went with the Blue UG. It came topped with imported English Stilton Blue Cheese and the accouterments. I choose waffle fries as my side and also the Homemade Steakburger Sauce.\n\nWhile I waited I entertained myself with some of that $10 wine. Always a good choice in my book. The burger came out a smidge more done than I asked (medium) but the quality made up for that. The flavor of the beef was exceptional. You can tell no pink goo was used in crafting this behemoth. This thing was thick and juicy (the bun suffered a bit) and as a result I committed one of my cardinal sins: I cut the burger in half. Gasp. I quickly got over it. The blue cheese was mild and creamy as it melted and the steakburger sauce (tasted like a richer, and spicier A1 sauce) really pulled the whole thing together. The waffle fries were tasty but didn't seem like they were made on-site.\n\nIt was throughly enjoyable and hit my burger craving spot oh so right.\n\nUnion Grill's menu has classic American favorites like Turkey Devonshire and Tuna Melts, and the atmosphere is friendly, inviting, and reminds you a 1980's game room (in a good way). These reasons plus more are why it was jam-packed with diners at 9 p.m. and will continue to be so for a long time to come. I'll be back... for that pot roast. You can count on that.",150356

I rate it 3 stars due to the staff being friendly and helpful. \n\nIf you are a big meat eater, you will enjoy this place. Also, if you like meat with lots of salt.",347634
2,"the ugly stepchild of Binkleys.  I'm a huge fan of Binkleys, but they should have just stopped at that.  The fries are amazing, but I don't spend that kind of money to go eat french fries.  The sole barely had enough meat to justify serving anything on the plate.  Moreover, that minimalist portion of sole was overcooked.

This hotel is a great moderately priced hotel and the renovations make it look a little nicer than it did before. \n\nThe hotel is pretty central strip. It's in between Aria and New York and right across from MGM. The hotel is pretty nice and the staff is good. We had no problems checking in or out. \n\nThere was one problem in that we had our do not disturb sign on the door all weekend but when we came back from a pool party on saturday we came into the room and one bed had been made. First, we had the do not disturb sign on because we didn't really need the room cleaned. Second, if someone was coming into the room to clean it, I would have locked my things up in my suitcase. This was a minor problem with us. because we didn't want our things being gone through which is why we had the sign up. But it appears that the sign was ignored. \n\nOther than that, it's a nice hotel. It's not the Bellagio but it's not Harrah's. It's a nice room that is in between the two in regards to luxury.",162906

1,"Worst customer service you can come across!  Stood at the front desk for atleast 3 minutes while 2 employees finished up their personal conversation.  I was there to buy a galaxy tab so she took my name and told me it would be 15 to 20 minutes.  I kind of lost time because I was sending texts and emails while I waited.  I noticed a lot of people started to complain so I looked at the time since my first text message was sent and it had been 45 minutes!  I went to the counter and asked where I was on the list,  she told me it would be 15 to 20 minutes!  When I told her she said that 45 minutes ago she snaps back and says \""sir these are estimates only\"" which at that point I turned around and walked out.  I wasted almost an hour of my time and they could care less.  I work in an industry where we have long wait times as well so I get it but it's all about how you come off to customers which most of the time you can turn a negative experience into a positive one.  I've never been to this store before and I won't be back.  I recently switched from at&t to sprint and have been very happy with sprint's service.  Corporate should really take a long look at this horrendous store and realize they are jepordizing their brand with stores like this one!

The check in staff was nice enough but we were informed upon checking in that tips were already included on our bills and we couldn't remove them.

So basically we were forced to tip our technicians the amount that MGM wanted them to be tipped, which I didn't think was all that awesome.\n\nThe spa is split into a men's and women's spa but all of the treatment rooms are shared - private, but shared between the two spas. They're well appointed with steam rooms and a large jacuzzi for each one. My dad got a deep tissue and said it was absolutely fantastic. My sister and I got manicures that were good but not worth the $160. We got them on Saturday and it's Tuesday and my polish has almost entirely chipped off! My tech used Seche Vite for the top coat so I know it wasn't that, but she had the balls to dilute the polish she was using on my nails with acetone in front of me... something that makes polish chip. For $160 mani/pedis I thought that was a really crummy way to handle your materials. My technician was sweet though and the actual manicure and pedicure were good.

I got frustrated and walked to the cashier and asked for my money back. I said I'd pay for the burger and fries my girlfriend ate but not the hotdogs. \n\nWhat made me mad was no manager took responsibility or tried to make it right.

You could get those items in a $10 lunch buffet these days.\n\nThat being said, it's not like they're completely devoid of decent food.  The day I went, there was a section where a chef will cut you a new york steak or a prime rib.  There was another section for king crab.  The issue here is that those items aren't anything special these days; The Mirage offers those as well for around $25.  Even worse is that the chefs were quite stingy with their meat, cutting me a small piece and telling me to come back later (presumably after stuffing myself with microwavable corn dog bites).\n\nIt seems to me that compared to more economical but quality buffets like the one at The Mirage, you're paying about $10 more for a larger selection at MGM Grand Buffet.  But the \""selection\"" we're talking about here is crap you could get from Hometown Buffet... hardly something I'd want to waste my time waiting in line for in Las Vegas.\n\nBottomline: If you're going to spend over thirty bucks for a buffet, go to the Bellagio or Wynn instead.  If you really must eat in MGM, go to one of their restaurants or even their food court with McDonald's.  Avoid the buffet.",204848
1,"Just went in to grab a small pizza after a 12 hour work day. Ordered a Casablanca WITHOUT mushrooms. Girl behind the counter even repeated it to me.....when I picked it up they repeated again NO MUSHROOMS and even opened the box to look at it...get home, SURPRISE!!!! MUSHROOMS. Baked all into this pizza. Thanks for the fungus. Make sure you check your pizza before you leave.....",248451
4,"Excellent location with good food and excellent service. \nWe got into this place after walking around Edinburgh, site-seeing and shopping. \nI passed by this little place the day before and I decided to come back and try it out. \nIt's a cozy little place, warm and comfortable. We were greeted from the door and seated immediately.\nWe started with couple of appetizers such as the infused game pate and grilled brie, and for main dish I ordered the steak with black pudding and my friend ordered the sauteed chicken in red pepper sauce.  Both of the dishes were well prepared. The steak and the black pudding just hit the spot. I also tried my friend's chicken and I loved that red pepper sauce.\nVeggies were a bit plain and maybe a little over cooked but the dinner was enjoyable and was fully completed with the great service we got from the woman working at the restaurant. I am not sure if she was the manager or not. But she was quite polite and helpful.\nI would love to come here in summer and dine out on the patio, it has such a nice and unique view...",354229
5,"I love Mandalay Bay! \n\nWhen you walk through the doors you get a whiff of a fresh breezy tropical lotiony scent . Located on the strip one of the first hotels you come across. Delano is also a part of mandalay. There are a great selection of shops... Lush is here too! \n\nThere is a tram or indoor walk route that leads you to Luxor Excalibur New York New York. \n\nRooms have tubs which I like. They have a cardio exercise room downstairs that's open to guests but the gym is part of the spa and they charge a fee for daily access. \n\nThere is a chapel, food court with subway etc, shark reef aquarium that's about $18-20 per person\n\nMy favorite thing about MB is their pools. Wave pool, lazy river pool with waterfalls. The best during the summer.\n\nLight is also here too.",172031

3,"Ohhh sweets and bright colors are my weaknesses. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? Yes please! \n\nWalking by the Sugar Factory on the strip was too enticing to pass up. This one, located outside Paris, is a fairly larger candy store then the other two locations (at the Mirage and the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops). \n\nTrue, most everything in here is really overpriced. But there are some cool things to look at. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? So tempted to buy. They have some cool novelty items, like couture pops, charm bracelets, hello kitty chocolate bars. I also found some key lime chocolate bars that looked interesting. Sugar factory has their own line of chocolate bars (2 for $5). I ended up picking up a 30 day supply of chocolate squares ($18). The squares are the size you'd see at Ghirardelli, and they come in a variety of flavors (milk, dark, raspberry, smores, caramel). Oh and did I mention cool packaging? It was a gift for my bf, but I'm eating a lot of it. Sharing is caring! =)\nThe chocolates are really good actually. The quality is up and there and the taste is really smooth without being too sweet. \n\nOh and the candy store has a gelato/ice cream shake bar. My friend wanted a scoop of gelato. One scoop is $6. Eeek. And the scoop was tiny! We tried the panna cotta. It was way too sweet! I don't think this place is worth it for a frozen treat fix. I'll pass next time. \n\nWhile I was at the store, I also noticed that it was attached to a dessert boutique. Didn't get to try it, but definitely want to next time.

1,"The hotel has a very confusing layout. Had to go to the back of the hotel to mess around with the parking. The parking garage is very small and confusing. The lobby was like entering a set of a 1970s tv show. Mirror chandeliers and out dated carpet. The check in line was very long and they only had 4 people checking guests in. I requested top floor and only got 17! I received 5749. I said there was no way that the room was on the 57th floor because the building didn't even look like it past 20 floors. We walked to the elevators which are beyond outdated. Scratched and scrapped up gold walls and Mirrors, doors and floors. I looked at the wall of buttons to push my floor and it had numbers 47-61? With arrows and other room numbers. I pushed 57 which is where my room was.  Got off and the sign in the hall said 17th floor but all the other signage says 57 but clearly we were not 57 stories high above the Vegas nightlife. It is extremely confusing and makes no friggin sense. That's all I ever heard the other guests complain about. The room we got was a \""luxury\"" in the \""renovated\"" Monoco tower. \""Renovated is an understatement! I think the last time it was update was in the 90's. The carpet on the halls was stained. The room doors are an old wood type very dark and ugly. The room was worse. It smells like mold as door are you open the door. The room was certainly not \""luxury\"" nor updated. The bathroom was terrible. Ugly old 1970's yellow bathroom tile and shower and old outdated bathroom fixtures. The shower head was the worst I ever had in a hotel. Everything in the room was dirty. The rugs the ceiling in the bathroom stains on the carpet. The desk and the pictures looked like it hadn't been dusted in years! The windows were absolutely disgusting and dirty. The view was pretty good except the view of the ugly buildings and dumpsters but overall it was a nice view. The bed was pretty comfortable I was surprised. The fridge didn't work and we had to tell them 3 times to replace it and they never did! We came one night and there was absolutely no parking! All the garages were filled and even valet was full! The one night we did valet the car it took almost 30 mins to get the car. And they were very short handed.  I didn't have any change to tip on me except a large bill so I went in the hotel to front desk and asked for change and the older lady told me no and I had to walk to the casino which was on the other side of the hotel to the cage to break it. Really? You can't give me some change? I'll never come back to this place. The casino was horrible. They advertise $1 blackjack and only have it On 1 table! Really? And they only had 3-4 other BJ tables but the min was $25. Really? The slots sucked and so did the players club which gave me a. $3.00 crappy shirt for joining and spending all my money in their hotel. The restaurants suck and are fast food places. Please update it. You can still have the history and old charm if you just update the dam place! Absolutely the worst! Save your time and energy and stay and play somewhere else!",133519
3,"This place came highly recommended by an acquaintance, but I have to disagree. I ordered a sirloin steak sandwich and got 3 thin slices of reconstituted beef (like Arby's uses).  My guest ordered a chicken sandwich.  It also had virtually no meat.  The greek salad was good and the side green salad was of a good size. The help was very young and inexperienced.",451085
2,Food was a-OK..not bad...; We ordered take out and it was nice to have parking spaces up front for the take out orders.\nHubby ordered the sea clams and specifically asked for two sauces - the red sauce and the tartar sauce.  The host said they always put the two sauces in there.  We got home and there was only the red sauce.  I called them and I told the host that the hubby was not happy....she laughs.... This was the SECOND time!  and to have a the host laugh at the situation did not help.  \nI had the mussels in the garlic white wine sauce which was tasty and plentiful.  I also ordered the hearty house salad.\nThe low rating was due to the host laughing at us.... what was that all about???,612679
2,"Very nice atmosphere.  Happy hour prices are reasonable.  The drinks are VERY good!  The place can get pretty busy and they could use a few more servers.  I would go back again.\n\n12/13: service is very, very slow tonight",577324
1,"So looking forward to this dining experience last evening...had been recommended by several folks in person and the reviews on Yelp only pumped up my taste buds more...\n\nIf this is Las Vegas Mexican food at it's best then someone needs to have their head examined....it was downright BLAH.\n\nChips and salsa up front was nice touch but Salsa nothing special. Beans were nice free touch too but tasted like straight out of a can. We had several palate's to please. picky 15 year old, 18 year old who loves fish and anything fresh, your texmex appetite and mine who embraces any different, fresh or just darn good food.\n\nHow can you mess up a plain chicken quesadilla... two bites and 15 year old  was done...tasted it and couldn't agree more. Shrimp enchilada sounds good and as there was so much shrimp on the menu you figured it was a easy home run. Chewy and fishy covered in a plain sauce...18 year old didn't get through a 1/4 of it and others at the table agreed. Chicken Enchilada, come on how easy is that...apparently not to easy! Barely passable and again just plain. I had the 3 pork chops, Chuletas was the dish name, marinated overnight in a secret sauce. Don't bother, chops dried out and the sauces only secret is that it smothered the pork chops in something I would only describe as tasteless.\n\nThe service here was excellent (besides 3 requests for water) and can't fault them in this regard. Almost all the people in their, both small and large parties seemed to be celebrating a birthday party and it was just way to loud. WARNING sign - they listed fish on the menu but all they had were shrimp. This leads me to believe they do not shop fresh produce, how can you not have fish tacos on the menu!!! Come on and yes this only dawned on me after.\n\nWe finished our meal and probably returned the food about 75 - 80% untouched. There was an apology from the waiter but no manager to come and ask why, no credit on the bill... NOTHING.\n\nWe left our tip and were out of there and likely to never return...$100 down the drain.\n\nI am rarely this bad when writing reviews but when you have options like Mundos in town and Don Juan for texmex/fresh food then I would recommend you steering clear of this over rated Mexican establishment.\n\nSorry Lindo...",145130
1,"I know I've been away for awhile, and that you all have been waiting with great anticipation for this update...\n\nI can now say officially, after FINALLY receiving all our furniture, this place deserves one star (if that).  Just a note; we also have been buying furniture from a place that is going out of business (Furniture Marketplace on Westinghouse Blvd.).  How can we be recieving stellar service, from sales point to delivery, from a place that is going out of business, when this newly opened store who presumably is trying to build a book of clients can't deliver a furniture order until a month and a half after promised delivery?\n\nPass on this one...with all the great furniture shops in town and in west north carolina, why put up with this stuff?",528172

5,"I'm surprised to see this place with such a low rating. Today was my first experience at Gallo's and, after reading the reviews here, I'm hoping that experience was not a fluke. Our oldest two sons had a birthday party to attend. We decided to take our youngest out for an early dinner. We arrived shortly after 4 and the place had a few patrons but was not at all busy. We seated ourselves and someone attended to us right away. The service was outstanding; very friendly staff. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing. The food? Excellent! Salads came with our meals and were brought out first. They were nothing exciting, just simple salads but I usually don't expect much with a salad. As long as it isn't brown I'm happy. We ordered garlic bread and it was perfect; crispy but soft. The marinara sauce was delicous. We also ordered the stuffed hot peppers which were awesome. I had the baked ziti and my husband had the lasagna. Both were delicious. We both commented on the fact that Gallo's reminded us of our favorite Italian place in Japan, Angelo's. Yeah, I know...Italian food in Japan? It was great though. Our son ordered the kid's pizza and we tried that too. I prefer New York style thin crust and this has a thick crust. But it is a buttery, garlic crust that is worth eating just by itself. It was a wonderful experience and a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe are definitely going back.",147527

Good food, quick service & polite people! \n\nI ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special not realizing it's spicy as it wasn't listed as such on the menu I saw, however, I brought this to their attention and the owner remade my order fresh without spice!! He was very polite and did not ask that I pay for what was ultimately a failure in communication. However, because of his service I will return!! \n\nThe food was fabulous and was made differently then I've seen before with mostly carrots & onions, but it was delicious!!

3,"I've gone to Dragon Fly twice now.  Once on a blind date and once with my partner and kids.  The blind date experience was okay; thank God they have $5 martinis-of-the-day.  \n\nMy return visit with my partner (not the blind date) and his kids was more enjoyable, but still nothing spectacular.  Dragon Fly offers your basic Chinese dishes that you'd find on a Chinese take-out menu, but they serve them to you in their dining room.  Good, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nOur server wasn't very attentive until the very end when we didn't want him to be.  We were seated and brought some of those crunchy Chinese noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard sauce.  With five of us, they were gone in no time and we never did see a refill.  And I liked that they had a $5 sour apple martini drink special, but my 2nd martini didn't come until I was done eating my meal.  It kind of ruins the excitement of drinking a martini when it's served as dessert.  Well...mostly.  Toward the end of the meal (not at the end, but toward the end), our server started clearing our dishes off our table before we were even finished!   My partner had turned away for a second and someone scarfed up his plate with some food still on it.  This infuriated my partner, but I, surprisingly, wasn't as bothered.  Maybe it was because I knew that \""dessert\"" was coming?  \n\nAt any rate, the food is average, drink specials on martinis are great, and the service is slow, but keep an eye on your plate.  It'll disappear before your very eyes!",212511

I could have gone to the Subway next door and gotten more and healthier food for half the price!! \n\nThen, I figured, the food must be super good quality right?  Wrong!\n\nIt wasn't anything too spectacular. The chicken was bland and fatty, but at least the rice came OK since there was a lot of it.

2,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for a Saturday night date. We were seated quickly by what appeared to be an owner. We'll call him \""The Boss\"" (tall man with a baseball cap on). The Boss sat us, bussed our table, wiped it down, and then gave us menus. Said our server would be with us \""shortly\"". \""Shortly\"" was the understatement of the year at this place. The Boss came back about 15 minutes later to ask us if we'd ordered drinks yet. We hadn't.  He ordered and brought us our drinks. 35 MINUTES LATER our waitress Morgan appeared. We'd been watching her serve the couple at the same table we were seated at and several tables near us for the past half hour. We ordered food. Entire order was wrong and Morgan didn't offer to take it back to have it fixed. We were also charged for food portions we didn't order as well as paid for the incorrectly prepared entree. We also watched the Boss seat a new couple next to us and get their drinks as well. The waitress finally asked if they needed new drinks/food an hour and ten minutes later after they had been sat. An hour. And ten minutes. Really? Really. The food here was amazing though. That's the only reason they got two stars. The boss was excellent as well. Hosting, bussing, serving, cleaning, and probably cooking. Food is great but good luck getting service!",420936

3,"My boyfriend and I came here over the weekend while we were in town for Spring Training. \n\nWe arrived around 8 pm and it was about 40% full on a Thursday night. They had a cover band playing at a reasonable volume but there is no ambiance music playing when the band takes a break so it does get a little eerily quiet.\n\n It's \""family style\"" seating. So you could be sharing your large table with others. They do have a bar top which you can sit at, and a patio with heaters.\n\nOur server seemed a little lost or new and would disappear at times.

The two plates of bread they brought out for the table of 15 were long gone and we hadn't ordered any food yet so we asked for the manager.  His rude and defensive response has to be one of the worst I've ever witnessed.  My brother was so annoyed he asked the guy to walk away.  When the food arrived it was sub par.  It certainly wasn't as good as it used to be.  The Mac n cheese was dry and flavorless, our meatballs were bland, we got about half as many padron peppers as we used to.  My shrimp ceviche was served on a different plate then it used to be leaving my tortilla chips to sit in the juice and become soggy.

3,"I've just been getting into tea as of late, so I've never been to a tea room. Oh and I found out the \""tea\"" I like is not really tea...my bad.\nSo I'm grading this place as more of a cafe.\nIt fit well inside an antique mall, so you can work up an appetite or walk off all the finger sandwiches and scones. \nThe room is small but there was enough room not to feel cramped. We were initially sat in their back private room but there was not alot of air flow and the sun was heating the room through its large windows. The waitress was happy to move our party into the main room, much more comfortable. The room reminded me of my grandmothers house but with plastic lawn chairs for seating. Cute, random table clothes decorating the tables. Staff was friendly and attentive.\nThe boys in the group got sandwiches and ice tea or lemonade. The girls got \""High Tea\"". I got the Strawberry Tingler rooibos. It was probably the best tea I ever had. I started with the corn chowder, very tasty with lots of chunks of vegetables. The finger sandwiches were good, fresh made, I added a little bit of salt to enhance them, but I like salt. The tuna was probably my least favorite. I preferred the Chicken salad, egg salad, and cucumber sandwiches. The scones were offered in 3 different kinds...apricot was the best, the cherry sour cream cam in second, the coconut chocolate chip I thought would've been the best, but I was disappointed. The jam and cream they serve along side is a perfect accompaniment.\nIf your looking for a new experience, its an affordable treat.",422383

And not even that nice Brown nutty color of fried rice, I almost thought it was spoiled food. \n\nThe lady on the phone said she heard me say I wanted shrimp, that's a lie I'm not suicidal and don't have an eppi pen. Why would I order shrimp lady.\n\nAlso she was giggling when I asked her if she got a lot of complaints. I didn't check yelp before I placed my order, if I had this would all have been avoided.\n\nShe offered to refund my money forty min ago.

5,"So I have visited this place several times in between my first review and this review and they have managed to keep their 5 star rating. Tonight was the epitome of it all! I could not believe how delicious my meal was. I did finally try a new sauce: Kung Pao, so I don't know if that was it or not but everything was cooked to perfection. It was the busiest I have ever seen the restaurant too. \n\nThe staff, which was clearly under a lot of pressure, did not compromise their customer service at all. There was a woman helping out the chefs who was extremely courteous and would help you out with whatever you want. She kept the line moving and was very efficient. The chefs were also really nice! My mom has a food allergy. When you mention you have a food allergy they clean the entire cook top and get new utensils. Most places have an attitude because it's extra work for them. Not this place, they were very nice and were able to accommodate my mom's request. Even when she asked for the food to be cooked well done with not a lot of water, the chef said \""sure\"" and made her food to perfection. \n\nLove this place!",199227
2,"Never again!!\nNobody acknowledges your arrival and you are left kind of hanging at the front door (please wait to be seated sign) until someone finally notices that you are waiting and yells from behind the counter to take a seat anywhere. \nIt took 10 minutes to even get a beer ordered (bottled Hoffbrau at $8 for a half liter-ouch, and no imported draft).\nThe uninspired menu is WAY overpriced for the mediocre quality even if the portions are ample, who cares to eat a bunch of slop.\nI've lived and traveled throughout Germany and this restaurant with an owner who obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction wouldn't survive for 1 year.\nI guess if I want to eat German food again in Las Vegas I would have to opt for the Hoffbrau Haus Las Vegas.\nGo to Cafe Heidelberg at your own risk-you will most likely be disappointed and overcharged.\nCaveat Emptor",66991
5,I started going to Hand N Stone @ Tatum & Cactus almost 6 years ago and plan to continue. Evey one there has always made me feel very comfortable and  special. I have never had a bad massage and I get who ever is available. Love this place,402384
2,"Sat down and was checking out everyones food. Looks ok, yeah we'll eat here. So my husband orders a beer, they don't have it. Ok he'll have this other beer on tap, NOPE don't have that either. wth? The handles are on the tap thingy. So they lady unscrews all the ones that are out. 4 out of 5 were out. wth? So my hubby got stuck with bud light. Then I order a hot chocolate. She walked around the corner still stirring it. Yuck tastes like chalky water. So I send that back and ask for a pineapple juice. They lady once again comes around the corner, this time licking her lips. Hands me my drink and says yeap that's good. My husband and I look at eachother. So I grab another straw and yep it's good but kind of hard to mess up pineapple juice. \n\nNow to the food, no untensils no condiments, had to ask for everything! \nSo I ordered a short stack of pancakes (2) with a side of ham. Pancakes were just ok, I can do bisquick better. Ham steak was cooked on the same grill as the regular steak so had a charbroiled steak taste. Yuck.\nMy husband ordered a chicken sandwich which came with curly fries. He truely believes the fries were frozen and the chicken sandwich too. He ate it but only because starvation kicked in. Which I would have went back to the BACKSTAGE DELI @ THE LUXOR_yum!\n\nSkip this place not worth the time or money. Hit a food court if you're that desperate.",133717
1,"This is by far the worst restaurant experience that I have ever encountered so far. I've driven by Sevens' plenty of times before they opened, looked them up online and was excited to try them out. Their menu looked really good and tasty. I finally got around to having dinner there this past weekend. The menu you see on their website for lunch & dinner is not what you'll see when you go in. Online, they combine both their lunch and dinner menus making it appear larger. But when we were there on a Friday night around 7, we were only given the dinner menu which was about half the size. Now that I'm looking at their menu online, the prices are also not accurate. It's probably because they're showing the lunch prices which are typically lower.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was dead. There were a few people at the bar and two other tables. We were seated inside the restaurant close to the patio. They had the patio doors open making it way too cold. Some heat lamps were definitely needed. Good thing I wore a leather jacket. The restaurant is really well decorated, clean, and modern. I didn't see what it used to look like as Avalon so I don't know how much they remodeled. We were greeted and seated right away.\n\nWe got the monkey bread and spinach and artichoke dip to start for 5 of us. The monkey bread was raw. At first we thought it was gooey cheese, no it was raw dough. Bleh! We told the waiter and he took it away and later brought us out a new one. The new one was clearly burnt. I didn't even bother trying it. The small piece of the first one I had was okay. Tasted similar to Red Lobster's cheesey biscuits with some honey. I thought it was supposed to have garlic butter? The spinach and artichoke dip came out on a huge plate. However, there were probably 8 wedges of pita to go with it. The dip was edible but way too garlicy. There needs to be more pita for the proportion of dip though. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the duck sliders to split and the lemon basil chicken. Other people got burgers, duck sliders, and french onion soup. The duck sliders were okay. I took the onion, cilantro, jalapeno off because I don't like them. We also asked for the spicy mayo sauce to be on the side. Good thing we asked if it came with a sauce since it didnt' say on the menu. If your familiar with those pork buns you can get at he Asian Bakeries for $2, that's pretty much what it tasted like. Good but not worth $12. My boyfriend at the sandwich with the condiments on it and said that it didn't go well together at all. The chips are those kinds you get at the fair. However, just looking at them, you can tell that they were drenched in the cooking oil. They were so soggy and flimsy. How did the cook see that and think it looked appetizing? Another person got the duck sliders which came out 15 minutes later for some reason and the chips were just as soggy. Our meals didn't really come out at the same time but I guess I'd rather get it right away than have it sitting under a heat lamp. The fries that come with the burger are similar to those from Steak and Shake (thin-cut/shoe string fries). Those were probably the best thing out of the whole meal. I was told that the burgers were good. Our lemon chicken was horrible. I've never had to return something back to the kitchen before but it just wasn't good and not worth $20. It was really sour (not sweet and sour, just sour) and the chicken was really rubbery. The chicken was in little strips, I was expecting an actual piece of chicken breast that you usually get at restaurants.\n\nOur drinks sometimes went empty but other than that our waiter was really nice and accommodating. He didn't question that the monkey bread was raw or that we didn't like our dish. \n\nI don't think any of us will ever go back. There are just too many other options in Old Town that are so much better. What a shame.\n\nGot a message from Jake J. probably someone who has a share in the restaurant since he posted those professional photos. An average diner wouldn't have access to those. Here's what he's got to say: \""Got love the complainers. They always have yelp accounts. I had to write once I saw your review. Monkey bread is my favorite and it is not raw in the middle it is melted cheese. Figured you would know that with your advanced pallet or see it with your own eyes. Can't please everyone. Ive been there so many times never had one complaint nor heard one around me until this stupid site that have so called \""wanna be food critics\"" didn't momma teach u anything..... If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. Guess not. Typical \""yelper\""\"" Funny because he has written unfavorable reviews in the past, some even promoting Sevens'. Some people are silly.",565029
2,Walked in on a Friday night and waited for someone to decide to help us. Lots of staff just walked by till finally someone came and helped us. There were visably at least 5 or 6 available tables but still we were told a 30-45 minute wait? really? we went across the street and got a table right away. This place is pretty but that seems about it all it has to offer.,609606
4,Worth it just for the view.\n\nWe only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)\n\nThe drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.,264892
1,"My first visit to Cadillac Ranch Las Vegas location was very disturbing. It revealed a culture of disrespect highlighted by inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. This culture of disrespect seemed to be fully reinforced by management who did not care to listen or address our immediate complaints.  Certainly such behaviors have a negative effect on Cadillac Ranch's profits and reputation, so I thought it worthwhile to address corporate management.\n\nEvidently, our bartender, Rachel (Bar3-t8), was not happy with the 10% tip we provided.  We were $1.50 short of 20% but we were not happy with her poor service.  She was belligerent loudly calling us \""Cheap ass mofos\"",  instructing security to \""get them out of here, they don't deserve to finish their drinks\"", and proclaiming, \""this is my bar, don't come back.\""  We sat their dumb founded that she would treat customers with such disrespect. We quietly left the bar area to seek the manager.\n\nOur group of four never imagined or has ever experienced such disrespect. After spending $25 as entrance fee, $25 for hookah, and $29.23 at the bar,  a total of $79.23, we wanted to let the manager know we felt we paid too much for  the insults. However, to make matters worse, we were informed by an assistant manager, that the manager \""was busy counting money\"" so we were to take his business card instead. Evidently, while he had time to count our $79.23, he did not have enough time to tend to our concerns.\n\nAs we make our complaints to Yelp, the BBB and the corporate office of Cadillac Ranch we are left wondering what sort of abuse we might have experienced if we left no tip. Are tips required even for unsatisfactory service? \n\nIt also begs the question, \""Is this behavior condoned by corporate management?\""  Or, \""Will we get some meaningful action from corporate?\"" I know from running my own business and having worked at a Fortune 500 company that substantive changes do not happen overnight, nor did the degradation of customer service at Cadillac Ranch. Typically a signal needs to be sent throughout the organization so that even long after this incident, a line item exists showing a problem occurred and other line items are created to initiate a long-term solution. I suggest a refund of our $79.23 is the needed signal that will also give us reason to try your establishment again.",385265
4,"After much research into finding a good buffet in Vegas, I found the Wicked Spoon. I had read some horror stories about other buffets, so I was pretty picky about where we ate on our first trip to Vegas. This buffet did not disappoint.\n\nFirst of all, it is expensive. $80 for two people, but that did include all you can eat and soft drinks. The buffet was the most high end I have ever been to. It had appetizers which included a variety of salads, a meat and cheese spread, shrimp cocktail and more. The main course dishes went on forever. Crab legs, bone marrow, lobster claws, mac and cheese bar, fried chicken, sweet potato mash, Korean short ribs, pizza, I could go on and on and on. My absolute favorite thing by far was the gnocchi. It was quite possibly the best gnocchi I have ever had, the sauce was fantastic, the gnocchi was perfect, soft and cooked to perfection. I would go back and only have that every single time. The dessert section also seemed to have an extraordinary amount of variety. Puddings, gelato, cake, pie, cheesecake, cookies, rice pudding, and my favorite, enormous chocolate covered strawberries dipped in Heath bar or Reese cups. Again, if all they served was gnocchi and those strawberries, I would pay for it time and time again.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, our server was great, she kept our table clear and our drinks full. It wasn't super busy when we were there, but I can imagine it would get a little crazy if it would be busier. I recommend an early dinner or late lunch because when we finished by 6:30p or so, people were pouring in. It's a place you must try, but you won't ever look at another buffet the same way!",492297
3,"I'm basing my review solely on the club and not the terrible bouncers and security outside. They seriously made our lives hell considering the fact that we got bottle service. We had a group of about 20 but six of us went in 5 mins after the rest of our group because we had to use the bathroom. Security was well aware of this by the way. Once we got back from the bathroom, a security guard yelled at us for not having a stamp even though he knew we were in the bottle service group. We dropped $1600 to get yelled at? Screw you police academy drop out, get a real freaking job. \n\nNow for the club. We had an amazing time overall, even though our waitress was a joke. I've had better servers at a Denny's restaurant who don't get $300 tips. The DJ was great and the club had an awesome atmosphere. We literally were dancing at least 97% of the time and a good time was had by all. I seriously recommend that the management retrain their security and servers though. They should be happy to have groups of people drop their hard-earned money during this economy.",184825
