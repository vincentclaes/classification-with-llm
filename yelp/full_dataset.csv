0,"Manager is a complete jerk. Customer service means nothing. I came in for dinner and drinks while restaurant  area was almost empty. I was told I could not sit at a booth because there were only two of us and we would need at least four. His reasoning was \""it might get busy\"". Instead we were seated at a small table where the game we were there for was almost impossible to see.  Pretty much every request was answered with NO for the entire meal by the waitress.  I had multiple experiences like this and finally had enough. I would go to the Tilted Kilt  or Arena just a few blocks away",252354
2,"Staff is cute and friendly. Coffee is meh. If you sit anywhere near the smokers, the coffee starts tasting like cigarettes. \n\nIt's definitely \""cool\"" and has that vintage retro hipster thing happening.",75653
2,"My favorite thing about this hot spot? The gelato bar! What buffet do you know that has all you can eat gelato with a good variety of flavors? This alone made my trip worth it! Not to mention the rest of the delish assortment of desserts! \n\nOne thing that you should be aware of is that the seafood buffet is only available on Fridays-Sundays for only 29.99. I unfortunately was not because I was ready to get my seafood fix during lunch on a Monday until they told us the reason why the lunch buffet was only $15 was because it's only on the weekends... Boohoo! Exactly why I took  a star off along with the next star because of their limited sushi bar that was not so great, which I wouldn't expect greatness at a buffet anyway, but they should have at least given more of a selection. The lamb shoulder however, was yum! \n\n$15 on weekdays for lunch, $22 for dinner... Same price for the weekends without seafood but with it's 29.99, which I think is a great price compared with the prices on the strip that's not as great... Belagio is still one of my faves!",378025
2,Food was good but portions were small and expensive for what you got. $22 for a pot pie.  Thought it would be larger but about the same size as a frozen Swansons. Got five medium scallops and 3 out of the 5 clams had no clams in it. I know vegas is expensive but this was too much.,583997
3,"My husband was out of town on Saturday so my brother Paul and I decided to get together, maybe look for a couple of Christmas gifts, and just kinda hang out together for the day.  After finding one gift for our Dad we decided to get some lunch.  Honestly, Squirrel Hill has so many great places that it's tough to decide.  We decided on getting some pizza, but which one?  Again, there are so many.\n\nWe decided upon Aiello's and called ahead to place our order.  You can eat there or take out.   We took it back to my place.  We're both musicians and we were planning on spending the afternoon jamming anyway.   Pizza and music--reminds me of my college days!  Paul had ordered from here before.  He suggested the \""White Pie\""  which is butter-garlic sauce and provolone cheese.  We got a 12-cut, 16oz pizza with tomatoes, spinach, and sausage on it.  I figured my husband could eat the leftovers for lunch.\n\nThe pizza was very good, but a little pricey here.  It was something like $25.00 for ours.  Oh and it's \""cash-only\"", but they do have an on-site ATM.  For your convenience!",77497
1,Cheeseburger sliders were.. aight. Not worth it for the price. \n\nService was friendly.,371166
2,"We have eaten here before but this last time was one of the worst experiences ever. Keep in mind it was not busy at this hour. We walked in and were greeted right away and quickly seated. After waiting 10 minutes someone casually dropped off 4 waters  but nothing else. At this point we had waited 15 minutes but still had no idea who our waiter was. We finally asked the lady in the front to be moved into another section and she quickly sat us somewhere else. After that we had to wait another 20 minutes for food and finally ate after what felt like forever. This was an awful experience and the manager came over and just apologized and walked away. He didn't say anything else, didn't ask us if we needed anything. It was  a very disappointing experience especially because we have eaten here many times before. On the bright side the food was good.",184003
0,"Terrible. \n\nMy spaghetti was overcooked and flavorless, the free wine was like vinegar (but what do u expect of free wine), the cappucino tasted like it came from a vending machine, the service was slow, and the old frail man on the accordian was kind of entertaining and cute until he asked for money.",131349
4,"Great place! Obviously all the burgers are top notch. The Rehab burger is over a half pound of juicy deliciousness. You can also get a half size burger thst is still plenty big.  They cook the burgers the way you order them. Too many places ask how you want your burger cooked than completely ignore your choice. Plenty of non burger choices too, delicious salads, yummy sandwiches and wonderful pastas. Awesome milkshakes, fries, sweet potato tots and pig wings (just try it). Great drink specials and happy hour for the cocktail and beer drinkers. Last but not least is a friendly and knowledgeable staff eager to please. Run, don't walk over to Rehab today!",558765

3,"Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.\n\nWe go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.\n\nOur first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.\n\nShortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the \""heavy\"" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!\n\nStrip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor.",257611
1,I really wanted a buffalo chicken salad and decided to get delivery from here.  I was excited that you could get your chicken tossed in any sauce so I just got hot and said wanted ranch dressing and nachos.  The salad was bigger than I was expecting.  I was disappointed in the tossed chicken.  It looked like they just poured hot sauce on top of my salad because I it was everywhere on top.  Then as I was mixing it up the bottom was all watery.  I was checking my receipt and noticed I was charged 50 cents for dressing.  Who orders a salad and it not come with dressing?,600866

4,Cafe Davio...ahhhhhhh.  I have bben delighted to many breakfasts and dinners here.  First breakfast.  It is not fancy but has serveral nice touches and menu items.....it is less expensive and beats out the local south side  competition as well as the national chains.\nNow dinner.  The quality and care that goes into the food is remarkable...and the protions are huge!  The menu has a slight seafood bent to it which is nice because Pgh lacks good italian seafood.  The waitstaff is very helpful giving very personal service.   Try and you will be raving!,400849
4,First time at this club last night! Omgosh I love this club already. Calvin Harris was awesome! He's so pretty. Dance floor is kind of small but it's alright. Had a super great time.

3,"There are lot of up sides to the Marketplace.  There are a ton of restaurants and shops to spend time at, especially if you are looking to kill time before / after a movie or want a date night!  The shops offer a variety of options from clothing to home decor to craft supplies.  Same goes for restaurants.  You can easily get some cheap eats here at Panda or drop a little more money and eat at Nori or Wolfleys (which are still not pricey options).\n\nLive music is offered every Friday in the main portion and the artists are always different and you can easily find out who is playing on their website. Seasonal offerings can also be found, such as Easter Bunny photos and the like.  \n\nThe negative here can be the parking lot and busy nature of the plaza. Since they are one of the only major plazas in the area, they are usually really busy and the parking lot can prove difficult to navigate and you may have to park and walk a bit.\n\nOverall: A\nGreat variety of shops and dining.  See a movie and make a date night out of it!  Leave yourself time for parking if need to be at something at a certain time!",212312

4,This is the best Hotel resort without a casino in Vegas. The Hotel is very new about a year old when we visited and very modern. The staff was very polite and helpful. There is not smoking in the hotel and also not casino so the hotel has a very relaxed  atmosphere. Their is a free 24hr rail service to take you to the strip within a few min when you are ready for Vegas. The spa was very nice (but pricy) my wife and I enjoyed our couples massages. The pool area is very relaxing and not overcrowded like some of the hotels on the strip.  I will be returning. \n(FYI this is a time share style resort so they charge a resort fee per night if you are not an owner),375867

2,"Real Foods, and Real Foods-esque shops are a bit like crack to me. They're totally addicting and I always end up buying things I shouldn't, or at least didn't intend to.\n\nSo, as a concept I really like Real Foods. It's just this location which gives me the case of the 3 stars, and that's in comparison to the Broughton St location.\n\nIt's *very* cramped, so much that whenever I paused to peruse the shelves I found I was in someone's way. I have found stocking to be a bit hit or miss as well, struggling to find exactly what I'm looking for when I know they carry it. \n\nOne of the beauties of a store like this is that you wander around and find new an unusual things to spend/waste your money on - the setup here doesn't encourage that at all. Good for my wallet I guess, but not so good for the business. \n\nMost recently I came in to buy gift certificates - these can be bought online but if you DO buy them online, you can only use them online. What?  What a strange and inconvenient system. Anyway, so I went to the store to buy them and they're actually kept in the back room somewhere so I had a reasonably extended wait while someone went to fetch these. An additional level of inconvenience. Staff were lovely while I waited, though, which certainly helps.",358028

Owners just are not welcoming",2709
1,This place gets two star for the lack of motivation and want to wait on people. How does anyone enter a business and they turn up they nose and treat u like go away. They need lessons on home training and classes on how to treat customers and life lessons on how to treat they fellow man.\n The odd thing is all the people who work here are older they know better. I asked fifty time for help did I get it no. I was getting ready to leave when one lady decided she should at least see what I wanted. I spent 200 with her just to show the others what a little hard work can do. Will I return sadly yes the husband loves this location. Although I cant see for the life of me why,136794
2,"This was the first time I have been able to attend the Brazilian Festival and I have been wanting to come now for a long time. So glad I came because I will not be returning next year.\n\nThe location is great, there's lots of space and parking available. They have the stage set up in the middle where they give great performances and have plenty of room where you are able to dance along with them if you want. They also have plenty of retail vendors and of course a small somewhat decent play area for the kids. \n\nThe food however, well I am very disappointed in that. Not enough food vendors, I believe there was only about 8-10 vendors. The Only vendor I recognized was Texas de Brazil, I did order their 3 meat sampler for $7, which of course was juicy and tender as I know their food is delicious. As for everything else, well, not impressed. I also ordered my Caipirinha for $6, which was ok. \n\nAll I'm saying is that for being a Brazilian Festival they should really have more food. The entertainment is good, the kid area can definitely improve. My suggestion, get your tickets through Groupon as you get a great value to attend and it won't feel like a waste of money when you too feel disappointed.",591841

2,"We go to Madison about once a month for various Badger sporting events. Sometimes we do double-headers and have to find somewhere to kill some time between the two events. \n\nLet me put in here that I was a little disappointed by Yelp Madison - the top 10 reviews are for bakeries and coffee houses, making it difficult to find what locals think is a great place to eat. \n\nAnyway, we ended up choosing the Old Fashioned a few days in advance, so I spent some time looking at the menu online and was really looking forward to trying some of their food. \n\nBecause of the timing of the events, we got there about 4:30. The place was still pretty busy considering it was pre-dinner time. It's a good thing we got there at that time, since it was absolutely stuffed to the gills by the time we left at 6. \n\nDespite having like 140 beers, they carry just one hard cider, which I think is a little ridiculous. But I ordered it. It wasn't very good. \n\nSo I perused the giant beer menu and went for an apple New Glarus I'd had elsewhere and loved. They were out of it. And before I could even go back to the menu, the waitress let me know they were out of 2 other fruit beers. However, the waitress suggested a beer on special that, based on the name, I'd never had tried, but it was quite good. So good on her for knowing the flavor profiles of what they had available. \n\nSince it was early, I was still pretty stuffed from lunch and the meals there all looked huge. I knew from Yelp that the fried cheese curds were a must and I couldn't imagine how I'd handle a whole meal, so I decided to piece on together. \n\nI ordered the curds for us to share, then ordered a side of the dill potato salad and a bowl of the beer cheese soup. \n\nThe curds were as advertised - spectacular. But everything else was a disappointment. \n\nThe beer cheese soup is clearly made with sharp cheddar - it had that good, sharp bite. But it was also incredibly gritty because hard cheese like that doesn't melt well. You could see the gritty pieces all over the spoon. It was just an unpleasant texture.\n\nAlso, because it was so sharp, it was kind of a lot - if you know what I mean. It needed some bread or a pretzel or .... something to break up the strong flavor. It came with a small packet of oyster crackers, but those just soaked up the soup and didn't accomplish anything. \n\nAnd the dill potato salad didn't taste anything like dill. It was ok, but not great, but I as someone who loves dill, I was really looking forward to it so the lack of flavor really disappointed me. \n\nSo I think the food was probably pretty ok, but after reading the menu I was really looking forward to these things and they failed to meet my expectations. \n\nThe boyfriend, incidentally, had the Saturday night Prime Rib special and it was delicious. He ordered the \""small\"" and the plate was huge, with a giant mound of onion strings, which I don't think he even touched, plus a baked potato and the Prime Rib. The Prime Rib was melt-in-your-mouth. \n\nI wish my meal had lived up to the promise of one bite of his. \n\nWe were in the room off to the left of the hostess station and there is a long bar there. As the restaurant got more and more crowded, so did the bar and there just wasn't room for all those people. Folks were bumping into the back of the BFs chair and the servers couldn't even get through.",179360

At $18 a plate.\nOur other two entrees came with rice also ice cold. The waiter made a comment that we should have said something about  the rice right away. But he was not around to complain. They did keep our water glass full because the bus boy was doing his job. Now I will be fare, I did order the Red Snapper and it was perfect.\nWe don't mind spending money on our dinners while on vacation, and we do spend a lot, but we will not return back to this restaraunt because they had both bad food and service with an attitude. \nI hope the owner/manger reads these reviews because they need to make some major changes if they want repeat business.",216448

2,"Seamless Club becomes a dance club at 4 am nightly, or rather, every early morning.  The area in front of the stage becomes a dance floor with the deejay spinning out house music.

As in, she really didn't know what to do.  As she sat there looking confused and looking around the restaurant, my husband suggested that we could grab a drink at the bar while she figured it out.  She looked relieved and went off to talk to a gentleman who worked there (we presumed about our seating).  \n\nMeanwhile husband ordered a martini, and I a glass of $18 wine.  At least it was a big pour.  The wine list was out of control expensive without being out of control excellent.  My baseline is Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label - in the local wine stores here, I can buy it retail for $35-40/bottle.  On this menu, it was $125.  After having a tremendous bottle of Rioja the night before at Stripsteak (at $85) that we were still reminiscing about while at the bar, we decided that by the glass was probably the best way to go.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we determined that our previous night's meal was so good, that neither of us would be opposed to going back if we weren't going to be seated by the end our our drinks.  Ten minutes later, husband paid the bar tab, the hostess was nowhere to be seen, and we took off for another delicious steak down the strip.",198291
4,"Dr. Khayami is a great Doctor of chiropratic and knows his stuff. He has a traction table that he uses during adjustments, which is rare, and awesome. Adjustments are done in a controlled and precise manner, and feel very safe. Dr. Khayami is passionate about what he does and takes time to educate you. He discusses where you are now, what you want for yourself, and how he can assist you in getting there. Treatments are effective and feel very personalized and genuine.\n\nHe has helped me reduce the scoliosis in my thoracic spine and reduced the \""finickiness\"" of my lumbar spine. Whenever I hurt myself or feel like my body is out of alignment I call Dr. Khayami and he can usually see me within 24 hours and puts me back into place!\n\nThe office atmosphere is casual and fun. Dr. Khayami is very respectful of his client's time. In the 30 or more visits I've had, my average wait time has been maybe 2 minutes. There may have been 1 time I had to wait for 10 minutes.\n\nHighly recommended.",430609

They finally got rid of the disgusting couches that were a hang out spot for homeless people, but there is still a seedy crowd that hangs out around the store. The tables are always dirty, there are crumbs and litter all over the floor, the bathroom was gross.... I wish it was enjoyable, because the location would be great for studying. I didn't notice it being any quicker than any other Starbucks. I avoid this store from now on.",112725
2,"Driving down the freeway I saw a billboard that said something like: \n19 times in a row voted best steak.. \n\nThis caught my eye real fast, so the following weekend I had dinner here.\nLocated in the Circus Circus Hotel & Casino, Its entrance looked quite elegant for its surroundings.. Walking in, there's a room that exposed raw cattle hanging from the ceiling ready to be charbrioled and served. I thought that was interesting. We got seated promptly and our waiter was very polite. \n\nI ordered the Ribeye steak with a side of  mashed potato (my usual combination). The bread was decent and house salad was good. The steak came shortly afterwards and had that charbroiled aroma to it. It was a hefty piece and had the right amount of char. The steak was pretty tender, juicy and had an all natural steak flavor. Overall it  was better than average but  not spectacular. The mashed potatoes were mediocre. The wine did help with the whole experience..\n\nOldschool Steakhouse that still Holds its own..",135859
2,"I thought this place was pretty average as far as Chinese food goes.  Decided to try it out because other reviewers mention the plethora of vegetarian options.  On the menu itself there are no more vegetarian options than most Chinese places offer.  However, they will vegetarian-ize most of the meat dishes (I got General Tso's Tofu).\n\nThat said, it was not the greatest tofu I've had--kind of mushy, sauce was a bit watery (...or oily...honestly I couldn't tell which).  It also was not spicy at all.  I'm sure they'll make it spicier if you ask, so if you like your food spicy you should probably request it.  My food tasted alright and was definitely a generous portion, plenty for leftovers.\n\nService was quick and the place looked clean.  The food was just very...average.",11813
4,"5 stars isnt enough for this place...... literally the BEST sushi i have EVER had..... they have so many different types of rolls and well a great selection of hand rolls.  i eat here about twice a week (which is not enough, if u ask me!!!).  the fish is so fresh, the flavors are amazing, and the atmosphere is fun too!  The staff are all friendly.  As soon as you walk in, the entire staff greets you. \n\n Some of my favorite rolls include the screaming orgasm, spring mountain roll, almost 90%, and the lisa hand roll.

2,"The experience of coming to Sandbar was decent but i don't think i would go again.  The service was the most disappointing aspect of it for me. To be fair they were very busy and I understand that but it was one disappointing aspect to the service tol many. To start off we didn't have menus for a good while after we got here. When our food did arrive finally i was left silverware-less for longer then I wanted to be when I was hungry from waiting for a good while earlier to even get my order in.  I had shredded beef enchiladas that were actually not bad. Not the best I've ever had but they were better than others as well with good black beans and rice as well.  \n\nMy friend had fish tacos, and this part of my review is hearsay admittedly, but he didn't like them too much. He could tell that they had used frozen mahi. If you have fish that's been frozen you're not going to have a good time. Truth. \n\nSo while I had food that was good enough my overall experience did not merit a return visit.",477312

The thin crust that we ordered was delicious. \n\nThe only reason I take a star off is for the wings. They were terrible. I ate one and could not stomach anymore. The chicken tasted old or rotten.

3,"CPR re-certification is just something you have to do as a healthcare professional.  We all moan and groan about it because there are a hundred other things you'd rather be doing for 3hrs. \nHowever, I've been going to Heart Savers for quite a few years now and they have managed to streamline their system pretty well. When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix. \nThe instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category. \nThe hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.\n Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually.\nThose of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years!\nOne note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.  But I heard cheaper rates being quoted in class, as well as higher ones (you pay once you get to class).",536287

Then you have to walkthru their rooms on the 4th floor to the spa, that's where the cafe is, in the spa.\n\nAs if that's not ingenious itself, there's no wait service.

However, my girlfriend is a big-time coffee fanatic and a barista.  She moved to the valley of the sun months ago and immediately tried to find a place that reminded her of home.  I can admit that I had never been to Solo because I rarely ever drank coffee, let alone went to a coffee house to sit around while drinking it.  Times change I guess.  At any rate, enough of my rants.  We went to Solo Cafe six months ago for the first time and absolutely loved it.   Yes, FREE wi-fi, which is always a good idea if you're running a cafe, a easy going atmosphere, \""coffee-esque ambiance\"" with bookshelves, tables, books and games.  The latte is awesome and if you're a sucker for sweet drinks like I am, I do highly recommend the White Chocolate Mocha.  Friggin' awesome.  I'm a pastry (cherry) and mocha man now thanks to Solo.

4,"So you get yourself a puppy or an adult dog and you find yourself with two choices.\n\n1. Don't train your dog. Let him/her run around and do what it wants, jump up on people, eat your furniture, bite people, pull your arm out of its socket when you walk him, etc, etc. \n\n2. Go to dog training classes. \n\nYeah, number 2 is the right answer. For a very reasonable price ($125) we signed up Anka our brand new 3 month old puppy. Anka is a strong-willed German Shepherd with a high drive and before training was happy to do anything SHE wanted to. After completing our 8 week training class, Anka can now sit, down, wait, stay on command and come when called. She walks on a leash wonderfully now. She doesn't jump up on people any more and she is a lot more comfortable amongst other dogs and people.\n\nLeah is very knowledgeable and patient. She spends time both with the class as a whole and with your dog individually. Every one of the dogs in our class improved dramatically over the course of 8 weeks. The transformation was quite amazing to see.\n\nI picked Leah because of her history with German Shepherds, but she knows about all dogs.

4,"Food that creates a smile is great food, but food that inspires--that's fantastic food.  The slider truck, although casually camouflaged with a comic theme and serving nothing but sliders, creates great eats that are inspiring for those who love to eat and for those who want to cook.  With the food comes the people, a plethora of individuals that somehow meld together into a friendly mass of hungry fans.  Despite the wait time for excellent sliders the people converse as if they know each other, making the wait seem like a few minutes rather than a bit longer.  I don't mind waiting in line with the cult followers because they are a mixture of artists, parents, students, geeks, photographers, and more.  While waiting in line for the slider truck you get an intelligent conversation in with great people. I love it.\n\nWith the crowd comes the need to feed, and the slider truck delivers wonderful morsels of juicy burger love.  They changed me, turning me into a fan of things I do not normally eat, and that is a feat in itself.  The menu is simple and there are days when they have secret menu items available as well, items that their regulars will wait an hour in line for just to get a taste.  Today it was the french dipper, a roast beef slider with melted cheese, onions and mushroom with a side of au jus.  I tried one and it was to die for--tender, juicy, packed from top to bottom bun and seasoned so well that I wish I ordered four more.  I will definitely dream of that french dipper till the next time it's on the secret menu.  When it comes to turning me, the pulled pork sandwich--one that I refuse to eat ever--became an instant favorite of mine from the slider truck.  It's perfectly cooked and the barbecue sauce is spicy, sweet, and oh so smooth.  That pulled pork is juicy and tender, well seasoned and the sandwich, although slider size, is packed full of it.  The other thing that I hate to eat are jalapenos, but they make a jalapeno jelly that I cannot get enough of on their Captain slider.  I could eat fifty of those burgers with the jalapeno jelly on it.  \n\nWith the mind changing food comes great service.  The owner handles the truck personally, along with three to four of his trusted friends that basically line cook to keep the food coming out fast.  They are all friendly, always smiling and they take extra care to pack everything nicely and with everything you need.  A great touch is the candy that you get with every order, because candy can make anyone smile even on a bad day.\n\nThese sliders are like no other.  They are amazingly filling, great tasting, with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The texture of the patties are perfect, and their sweet rolls that they split into a bun are yummy.  I love the slider truck with all my heart, and they inspired me to try something different every once in awhile.  if you think that this food truck is like others, serving plain food fast and greasy, you have it all wrong.  They serve unique, what I consider gourmet style sliders on the fly. With great prices and service, and the fun crowd and fun times trying to find the truck daily, this is a stop that I'm willing to drive across town to line up for any day of the week.\n\nLine up soon and get your slider fix today, before the food runs out.  The crowds are a plenty, but the specials may not last till you're ready to show up.  That's the fun in this truck--finding it, lining up, talking to people, and then finally eating your addiction.  Get it hot and fast with a smile.  What more could you ask for?  As for myself, nothing.  They are everything that I need when I want my burger fix.\n\nThanks for the inspiration, slider truck.",448147

I love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as Paradise Bakery, Chipotle, ColdStone Creamery, etc. In the summer, they have the misters going and in the winter, it is the fireplace. There is also a Harkins movie theater. Apart from the middle strip of shops, I like that I can hit up a Target, Ulta, BevMo in one stop. Who cares if I need to drive across the marketplace, the key thing is that I don't have to drive across town to find shops that are all in one place...so convenient. I don't get the parking complaints from other reviewers. How is that the fault of the marketplace? There is an over-abundance of parking spots, but it can be hard to find a spot due its popularity. If you are a bargain shopper, you can go to their website and print out coupons for its shops. My husband and daughter got BOGO frozen yogurt from Mojo Yogurt today. There is also a little splash pad in the middle of the shops that is great for the little ones. This is a great place to cover anything you might need.",290100
3,"We were seated right away around noon on a Sunday, the service was fast and concise, and the food came fast. There was not a huge selection of carts, but almost everything we had was up to dim sum standards and great. The shrimp balls were excellent, and the \""deep fried dumplings\"" were amazing--we think they had pork in them, but either way they were great. Definitely easy, delicious, and very typical for dim sum. We will definitely go there again, but it wasn't quite as good as our Chinatown place we used to go to in Atlanta.",123792

2,"Rides are awesome, and like any amusement parks, in order to avoid lines it is suggested to come early in the afternoon.\n\nI bought a season pass and the place was awesome for watching the international fireworks festival.\n\nThe restaurants are overpriced and the drinks are extremely expensive. However La Ronde does not check your bag and they allow you to bring your own drink (water, soda, no alcohol).\n\nThey closed some of the rides I used to enjoy few years ago, but they are constantly renovating and building new rides.",338429
2,"Great selection. The manager on duty was so nice and accommodating. But, I walked in at about 7:55 and was told by a salesperson before I even walked in that I would need to hurry because they were closing in 5 min. I was coming to get pillows and I thought that was pretty rude.",245234
3,"Usually Vegas buffets are a gluttonous amount of mediocre food. The Buffet At Bellagio is not that. The food ranging from mussels, fresh carved turkey, pesto mash potatoes and bagel with lox will satisfy families and the hungover! Go now on an empty stomach and enjoy:)",178267
2,"Ohhh sweets and bright colors are my weaknesses. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? Yes please! \n\nWalking by the Sugar Factory on the strip was too enticing to pass up. This one, located outside Paris, is a fairly larger candy store then the other two locations (at the Mirage and the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops). \n\nTrue, most everything in here is really overpriced. But there are some cool things to look at. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? So tempted to buy. They have some cool novelty items, like couture pops, charm bracelets, hello kitty chocolate bars. I also found some key lime chocolate bars that looked interesting. Sugar factory has their own line of chocolate bars (2 for $5). I ended up picking up a 30 day supply of chocolate squares ($18). The squares are the size you'd see at Ghirardelli, and they come in a variety of flavors (milk, dark, raspberry, smores, caramel). Oh and did I mention cool packaging? It was a gift for my bf, but I'm eating a lot of it. Sharing is caring! =)\nThe chocolates are really good actually. The quality is up and there and the taste is really smooth without being too sweet. \n\nOh and the candy store has a gelato/ice cream shake bar. My friend wanted a scoop of gelato. One scoop is $6. Eeek. And the scoop was tiny! We tried the panna cotta. It was way too sweet! I don't think this place is worth it for a frozen treat fix. I'll pass next time. \n\nWhile I was at the store, I also noticed that it was attached to a dessert boutique. Didn't get to try it, but definitely want to next time. The dessert boutique and the candy store is open 24 hours!",460936
3,"Came in a few times before and ordered drinks with dinner.  The trick to liking this place is to order drinks at the counter.  That was you get to see the giant hunk of ginger, see the bar tenders squeezing limes, watch them actuallly muddle drinks with care.  The drinks are good, but the show, even better.",305446
2,"Met up with friends on a Saturday night, so it was packed. Later in the night the number of children dropped. For something out of the ordinary, it's a good time but a but a bit expensive.",350689
2,"Overall: Come here for the crab legs, salad, shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp, the corn on the cob, free champagne and the tiramisu! Other than that, this buffet isn't anything special compared to the other ones. Wish they had better dessert selection (the ice cream are those machines from Souplantation, although they do have waffle cones). \n\nCompared to the other buffets, I feel like Bayside is on the lower end of the wow spectrum. I've eaten at Rio's buffet, Paris and the Spice Market, and I feel like all three of those were better than Bayside. The only reason we came here was because Mandalay Bay offered us $75 for us to spend on any of their dining facilities.  So for about $50 for four people, it was a pretty decent meal. \n\nThe price may be cheaper on regular days, but Vegas is really spicing things up and taking advantage of the Christmas season. No longer are the buffets only expensive on Christmas DAY, but they've taken the whole Christmas week and jacked up the prices by about $10 to $20 dollars! Because of this, there weren't that many people the night we ate here. Granted we arrived at around 5:30 for dinner, but we were seated fairly quickly. \n\nThey have different dining areas, but my mom wanted a table of its own rather than sitting at a booth connected to two other tables. We got a very nice table close to the salad bar with a very nice elderly waiter. Throughout the night I felt very sorry for just giving him all my plates of uneaten food or food I just wanted to try because he had so much to do and so many other people to serve. \n\nAnyway, there's the salad bar (with lots of different toppings - turkey, corn, mushroom, etc and a plethora of dressing), the Italian station, sushi/breakfast/shrimp cocktail, Asian food, an Italian pasta station, a prime rib/turkey/chicken station, crab legs, dessert and a champagne/beer bar section. \n\nThe champagne and beer are included in the fee you pay. I was so excited going up and asking for a champagne, and they didn't even card me! Anyway, the food selection is pretty good but the food itself isn't so great. The ribs were icky and cold, the prime rib tasted fake (just like at the Victorian Cafe!) and the pasta wasn't too tasty either. \n\nThe best things there were the shrimp cocktail, the salad, the fried shrimp, and the hot crab legs (make sure you get big ones as people tend to take those right away), the hot corn on the cob and the tiramisu! Loveeddd the tiramisu out of all the other desserts. I think I ate four or five of those in the little small cups. Left a tip for the waiter and left on a slightly happy (because of the tiramisu) slightly disappointed mood.",218512
3,Only had soup and salad and it is hard to mess it up but the soup (lentil) was delicious and most importantly it was hot. The house salad was adaquate.  Service was friendly and timely. I would recommend this bistro for its price and food,21818
0,"I figured since the reviews were good that I would be happy. Quite the opposite. Is a simple high fade to much to ask? I guess so, since now I have to shave my head. I guess a high fade means a high and tight jar head style. I wanted to stay inside military regs is what I said. Well, the top is varying in length anywhere from 2 inches to .5 an inch. On top of it all they charge an extra 2 dollars to straight razor you....hmm I'm pretty sure everywhere else that's included.

4,"This is 1 of 2 of my favorite breakfast spots in Charlotte. I like it because while they have the usuals of eggs and waffles (both with a twist you won't find in diners), the French inspired menu gives Cafe Monte a uniqueness I haven't found elsewhere in town. Crepes, quiche, great espresso, even steak & frites are all good bets.",342469
0,"Ug.  First of all - whose idea was it to put all the rental agencies 200 miles from the airport???  Secondly, how is it that Hertz had a line an hour long while all the other car rental agencies had no one in line???  Something is seriously messed up here.  Once I finally got my keys, the parking lot number the car was supposed to be parked in didn't exist which led to the fun \""find the rental car\"" game because there was zero staff in the garage to help.\n\nOn the way back to the airport, it took us forever to find the car drop-off location because the signage sucked so bad.  The actual process of dropping of the car wasn't bad but then you had to wait for a bus and drive 200 miles back to the airport.",90846

They promise you that if you pay for the listing you can contact the owners directly. They don't mention that it's by mail only!! In addition, they have a prewritten letter they have for you to send to the owner is to request for a rent to own. I don't even want to own a home. The listing on Trulia was for rent. I thought that they were legitimate because I have paid for a similar service before from a different company however I actually received direct contact information. Also I assumed that since it was on Trulia then it was ok (that was my fault for assuming). I have also seen them on Zillow so be careful. I wish I would have read Yelp first. I hope this helps someone before they make the same mistake I did.",599667

I even get postcards to remind me that I was robbed and got zero justice!\n\nI went to the police the next day and was told that this was the usual runaround they give people who are robbed in their casinos, so that they don't look bad.

2,"First dinner in Montreal and hotel concierge recommended.\n\nA very nice and elegant decor, a bit upscale but not too over the top.\n\nYou felt they honored great service.  The sushi on the menu seemed pretty normal to me but a bit on the pricey side for what you are ordering....presentation is their strength and we were very pleased with that.  \n\nThe sizzling Black Cod was amazing and a generous portion.  \n\nSushi for two with two glasses of wine, $89.  It hit the spot though.",337607
3,"I agreed with some of the post that say this restaurant offered the items you don't regulary see in most Thai restaurant.  The menu is big and has many variety kind of food from noodles, rice, steak, curries and salad depends on what mood you're in. Pictures on the menu is a big help to kinda give you the ideas of what the food will look like. They did a really good job on that.\n\nService is nice. In fact I got all the servers waiting on me.  Place is very clean and modern. The staffs were friendly and attentive. For a quick lunch it's nice to be able to grab 2-3 items food from what they called a la carte which is prepared food similar to Panda Express. The price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would recommend anyone who want to try their a la carte to get in before 1.30pm for fresh food. Otherwise if you get there later than that it seems like the food is old and had been sitting there for a while.\n\nI have no complain about the food here. Food is always good and full of flavor. They have the best Pad Thai ever! Must try! I tried to order something different everytime I go there. So far so good.\n\nI got a kick out of reading the review below that give Thai Cafe 1 star. Seems like this is their first time having Thai food and they have no idea what to order. I went there on Friday and saw the happy hour stand on the table that says $1 off appetizer/salad between 5-something and during the football game. Also the Thai beer was only $3. \n\nI've never heard of chicken in papaya salad before. If I'm wrong please let me know but I think you're mistaken it for something else? Papaya salad is very refreshing by the way.\n\nGinger salad is supposed to be grounded meat wasn't it? There was a picture on the menu I believe. I ordered mine with chicken. It had a very good flavor but too much ginger for me.\n\nOverall I have good experiences so far with this restaurant. It's our favorite Thai restaurant! Don't judge the place by the reviews, go try it yourself.",448914
2,"My dogs and I go to Cosmos often, with mixed experiences.  Like any dog park, we've run into some clueless jerks who don't pick up after their dogs (why is it always that giant mastiff taking a dump the size of my arm?) and don't control their animals.  I've been jumped on by Yorkies and Pitbulls alike...Cosmos takes all kinds.  Same as any bark park -- watch your dog like a hawk to make sure they're minding their manners and protect them from potentially aggressive dogs with your calm, assertive energy.\n\nThe thing that blows my mind about Cosmos is that people let their kids play there...it's a DOG playground not a CHILD playground.  I was there on Veteran's Day and there were a couple of moms who were letting their babies play in the gravel by the water like it was a day at the shore.  IT IS NOT A REAL BEACH PEOPLE!!!

1,"I met friends here on the suggestion of Happy Hour eats n drinks. Arriving to the restaurant there were only 2 parking spots open and they were behind the beer truck that was blocking them, next to a foul smelling dumpster and gas tanks sitting out in the open. \nIt was about 4:15pm on a Tuesday. \nI parked and entered and found the ambiance pleasant. I would recommend some blinds for the atrium seating so that during sunset your customers arent in a greenhouse.\n The server was exceptionally polite and helpful and attentive. He even escorted me to the ladies room and advised me they were unisex. He was just a peach! \nThe unisex bathroom however, reeked of urine. There's a reason ladies prefer their own lavatory! \nStructurally speaking, and this is being really picky, when you wash your hands in their unique sink, the faucet sits so low to the basin that your hands come close to dragging in the dirty basin that others have used. Icky. \nOnce the last minutes of happy hour grew near though, our server's attention, understandably, waned. They got slammed. Perhaps a drink runner for that last hour of happy hour would have aided us in getting our drinks BEFORE closing out AND paying our tabs. \nThe food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd, they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections. They fell flat.\n I then ordered the olive medley and a bread loaf which they purportedly bake on site. The olives were plentiful and tasty. The bread however was burnt. It had big empty holes in the middle so the amount of bread was slight. \nOur cocktails were also unique, however some of them fell flat while others were so immensely strong we had to send 1 or 2 back. \nThe reason i will never return to St. Francis isnt even any of the above although it contributes. But the icing, the cherry on top was departing the joint. \nNow I get why these hipster trendspots hire valet companies. The need to \""accommodate\"" the customer who drives, is hopefully met by an attendant who crams your car into a packed lot meant for only about 16 cars. \nWhen I arrived there was no valet to squeeze me into my spot behind the beer truck, next to the dumpster, near the gas tanks. But when I left my car was again blocked in, this time by other cars which had been sandwiched between my rear and the cars in the lanes behind mine. \nit took quite the effort and my passenger getting out to guide me, to get out of my spot safely.\nOn my exit, backwards, through the lot and around a corner, only then did I notice the valets. One was running about, the other seemed  a bit oblivious, flustered. I rolled down my window, and said \""You guys have to be kidding the way you block people in, \"" I said smiling, trying to make light of the situation. \n\""Most people know.\"" he replied.\n\""Know what?\"" I asked.\n\""To let us know.\""\nConfused, I wasnt sure what he meant. \nMy passenger said \""You guys blocked her in and she could barely get out.\""\nThe attendant responded, \""Look lady, that's the name of the game.\""\nMy passenger said \""What game is that?\""\nHe replied sarcastically, \""Well if you've ever been to St. Francis...\""\n\""I have not\"" I cut him off as he continued to try to explain that we should have known to come let them know so they could move cars to let us out. \n1st of all, from my spot I couldnt see that there was even a valet set up.\n2nd of all- to get your attention then to wait for you to rubix cube cars around would have inconvenienced me, YOUR CUSTOMER AND THE PATRON OF THE RESTAURANT THAT HIRES YOUR DUMB ASS TO CAR JOCKEY! \nTo which i replied \""I have not been here before and I wont be back now\"" to which he replied\n\""Well good \"" and rolled his eyes.\nSt Francis- the valet is the first and last impression of your restaurant. And that is why, more than anything else, I wont be back and I try to avoid places that use valets b/c they are too cheap to buy extra land to accommodate the numbers their trendy new spot might bring in. Additionally 9and not in your case since our drinks were priced for happy hour) my money that pays for inflated bar and food prices should cover me for FREE PARKING and not to have to pay or even tip some juvenile dipshit whom I wouldnt let drive my car if he was my own relative!",250256

I admire the stamina, strength and willingness of the performers to put on a great show, despite a couple boo-boo's.  The main issue are the cultural differences with the audience.  During the performance the performers begin sort of a chant-cadence with clapping hands...Now, I'm not Steve Martin in \""The Jerk\""...I can get my groov on...but they would keep changing it up and then frown at the audience for screwing up.  Very entertaining albeit a lil juvenile production...but fun!",283365

The prices are high, but balanced with a pleasant dining area, lots of menu options and daily specials, and what might be the most friendly and accommodating staff I've ever encountered.\nI've no complaints about the food. I've had dishes that I'm taken back by with complex flavor and presentation and others that simply meet expectations for what a good meal should be, but nothing has ever been bad. Not everything is knock-my-socks off though, so 4 stars. You can't go wrong with the seafood here. Scallops are probably my favorite. \nFinish your meal with a toasted almond cake and a spanish coffee (beware the massive amount of brandy snuck into this) and be fortunate enough for the owner to consider you worthy of a complimentary43 aperitif and you've just had a very good start to your classy night out!",522495

I ordered it medium, yet once again it was undercooked.  I didn't send it back because the people I was with kept on telling me how good a restaurant it was, and so I didn't send it back because I didn't want them to look bad..  So instead, I choked down my undercooked steak sandwich.\n\nThis last time I ordered the scallops.  They did not taste fresh at all.

3,"I am far from expert in this field of  sushi but I've tried a fair amount at a fair number of places, and I thought this was exceptional. I already liked the Korean food at the predecessor C J B Korean establishment and now I have a new favorite place for sushi as well.  \n\nBlack suspended tile ceilings with dark concrete floors, walls of bright green and some modern oriental art in between. Slightly spare, clean, modern feel to the place.  Men's room was spotlessly clean, modern with up to date fixtures, stocked with all the necessities. \n\nOur young server was friendly and attentive and our water glasses never went dry - except when I bumblingly knocked mine over, which was taken in stride by staff, and quickly replaced with a fresh glass. Service, from being seated, to order taking, to delivery food, to delivery of the check, involved no undue delays.  In fact, as Norm R noted,  service was almost too efficient as servers were anxious to whisk away our plates almost before we cleared them, but I'll take that over that experienced by another reviewer any day.\n\nNow as to the FOOD, Excellent in every way.  Beautifully presented, multiple distinct flavors. Best shumai ever tasted. Tongue tantalizing tuna tataki, rich, red, flavorful, and our accidental order, the \""OhYa I Forgot\"", was a definite \""no regrets\"", the closest thing to a dessert sushi I've ever encountered with its touch of peach.  \n\nAnd finally, we didn't go away hungry, indeed as one should not from a $65 + tip meal for two, but you need not spend nearly so much.  There are considerably reduced happy hour prices and several \""chef's surprise\"" samplers at under $20. \n\nThe service we received was \""comfortable\"", perhaps more friendly than polished, and that's just fine by me.  I highly recommend with the hope the service you receive is as good as we got, and not the indifference experienced by another recent reviewer below.",234123

It provide all that was needed. Clean room, great customer service, breakfast. I must admit the breakfast wasn't the best but at least they try. The restroom sink was situated outside the restroom which was kind of odd but no biggy.  Conveniently located next to eateries within walking distance and a supermarket in a 5min drive. Our check in was easy and fast, parking was easy, and yes we had little noise with a occupants of the hotel being mostly football fans but it was no big deal. People out having fun.

2,"3.5 Stars\n\nWhen I am building the perfect salad bar buffet in my mind, Sweet Tomatoes comes pretty close.  I understand that this is a chain and can not expect them to cater to my likes 100%.  As you walk in they have a few pre-made salads and in my made up place they would make your salad with the items you like and mix it along with your dressing selection in a bowl for you.  They have enough toppings to make your salad and a good variety of salad dressings.  They offer hot pasta items, muffins, bread, focaccia bread, soups, fruits and frozen yogurt.  I may have missed a few items but am painting a decent enough picture for the folks who never been to a Sweet Tomatoes.  I would like to see smaller batches of ingredients out on the salad bar with more frequent replenishment to ensure the freshest items are out all the time, again this is a item I would do in my made up salad bar.  The price is a bit high as well but usually are able to find coupons online to offset the cost a bit.",17806
3,"I expected the other people in my party to be raving about the eats and drinks we devoured. Apparently, however, our server was the most appetizing element of the entire evening, because that's all they talked about. \n\nI'll admit, even I took a second glance at the clean-shaven stud that took especially careful care of the ladies... and gents, in our group. Dude delivered the goods in style. But, gee, I must've been the only one who was thinking about the meat inside the folds of those tacos after we left. Seriously flavorful delights, folks. Dine on the swine, for sure, it simply knocks the other land-based meats, chicken and steak, out of the water. This goes for the domestic style corn wraps and the crunchy lettuce wraps, equally. Artistically rendered and inspired plates abound at the Mission. And I'll drop a big thumbs up for the kale salad, I thought it was fabulous; this admission surely wins me Metrosexual points, yes? \n\nFinally, the drinks. As a general rule, the further you wander from the familiar path, here, the better. While everyone was quite comforted by the house specialty margarita (and it was tasty), I found much more complexity and delight in the unusual options on the menu. Top it all off with a sitting on the lovely patio, and your Mission, should you choose to accept it, is impeccable.",356374

2,"I'm basing my review solely on the club and not the terrible bouncers and security outside. They seriously made our lives hell considering the fact that we got bottle service. We had a group of about 20 but six of us went in 5 mins after the rest of our group because we had to use the bathroom. Security was well aware of this by the way. Once we got back from the bathroom, a security guard yelled at us for not having a stamp even though he knew we were in the bottle service group. We dropped $1600 to get yelled at? Screw you police academy drop out, get a real freaking job. \n\nNow for the club. We had an amazing time overall, even though our waitress was a joke. I've had better servers at a Denny's restaurant who don't get $300 tips. The DJ was great and the club had an awesome atmosphere. We literally were dancing at least 97% of the time and a good time was had by all. I seriously recommend that the management retrain their security and servers though. They should be happy to have groups of people drop their hard-earned money during this economy.",184825

There is no size on the coupon, like I said I used the same one a few days ago.  She calls over her manager who tells me if the computer does not recognize it they do not take it. I said \""Seriously\"" and her manager turns around to me and says \""Yeah Seriously\"" ..No I am sorry . nothing .

I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\n\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \n\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.

If you're looking for a unique experience in Las Vegas, this would definitely be a place to have one. My friend and I love burlesque so if you're not so much into that, I don't know if you'd like it as much as we did.\n\nThe truffle mac & cheese is to die for. I've ordered that at a few other places and Cathouse, by far, had the best. The mushroom ravioli was a bit hard but it still tasted good. The dessert menu here is to die for. I have only eaten at an average percentage of Las Vegas restaurants but I'm pretty sure this is the only place where you'll be able to order red velvet cake and peppermint cotton candy.\n\nThe burlesque atmosphere manifests itself in almost every detail of the restaurant. The red patent leather doors, the black and white pictures on the walls, the waitresses' outfits, the interior of the restaurant, and best of all, the window. As someone who has no interest in nudity but loves to watch sexy girls dance, I really liked that every half hour or so, a very attractive girl would appear behind appear in a small room behind a large glass window. She would change behind a blanket, apply makeup to herself, read, etc.\n\nThe food is reasonably priced and tastes delicious.

There's a certain manly aspect to shambling through the woodpile, getting your hands dirty, and then going home to build a fire.\n\nTheir selection is fantastic, REAL hardwoods that take a nice amount of time to burn down. The staff was real friendly, although one of the dudes working there was pretty scary in that prison-tattoo-make-sure-you-lock-the-car sorta way.\n\nThey measured my buddy's pickup truck and did some quick calculations, saying that to fill up the bed it would be $160. Since I didn't have that much cash on me they instead directed me to a roll away cart that we could fill up to the line myself for $86. We went for the cheaper option, and I honestly don't think we could have fit another $70 worth of wood into the truck, but I suppose I could be wrong. You DO have to pay for better wood to burn, and it's not exactly plentiful in the middle of the city.\n\nI don't think I'll need another truckload anytime soon, but I do think it's definitely worth the drive when you look at what you get versus what's available at the gas station or even Home Depot.\n\nI'll probably be back for a big bag or two before winter is over.",250520

0,"My first visit to Cadillac Ranch Las Vegas location was very disturbing. It revealed a culture of disrespect highlighted by inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. This culture of disrespect seemed to be fully reinforced by management who did not care to listen or address our immediate complaints.  Certainly such behaviors have a negative effect on Cadillac Ranch's profits and reputation, so I thought it worthwhile to address corporate management.\n\nEvidently, our bartender, Rachel (Bar3-t8), was not happy with the 10% tip we provided.  We were $1.50 short of 20% but we were not happy with her poor service.  She was belligerent loudly calling us \""Cheap ass mofos\"",  instructing security to \""get them out of here, they don't deserve to finish their drinks\"", and proclaiming, \""this is my bar, don't come back.\""  We sat their dumb founded that she would treat customers with such disrespect. We quietly left the bar area to seek the manager.\n\nOur group of four never imagined or has ever experienced such disrespect. After spending $25 as entrance fee, $25 for hookah, and $29.23 at the bar,  a total of $79.23, we wanted to let the manager know we felt we paid too much for  the insults. However, to make matters worse, we were informed by an assistant manager, that the manager \""was busy counting money\"" so we were to take his business card instead. Evidently, while he had time to count our $79.23, he did not have enough time to tend to our concerns.\n\nAs we make our complaints to Yelp, the BBB and the corporate office of Cadillac Ranch we are left wondering what sort of abuse we might have experienced if we left no tip. Are tips required even for unsatisfactory service? \n\nIt also begs the question, \""Is this behavior condoned by corporate management?\""  Or, \""Will we get some meaningful action from corporate?\"" I know from running my own business and having worked at a Fortune 500 company that substantive changes do not happen overnight, nor did the degradation of customer service at Cadillac Ranch. Typically a signal needs to be sent throughout the organization so that even long after this incident, a line item exists showing a problem occurred and other line items are created to initiate a long-term solution. I suggest a refund of our $79.23 is the needed signal that will also give us reason to try your establishment again.",385265

Beans were nice free touch too but tasted like straight out of a can. We had several palate's to please. picky 15 year old, 18 year old who loves fish and anything fresh, your texmex appetite and mine who embraces any different, fresh or just darn good food.\n\nHow can you mess up a plain chicken quesadilla... two bites and 15 year old  was done...tasted it and couldn't agree more. Shrimp enchilada sounds good and as there was so much shrimp on the menu you figured it was a easy home run. Chewy and fishy covered in a plain sauce...18 year old didn't get through a 1/4 of it and others at the table agreed. Chicken Enchilada, come on how easy is that...apparently not to easy! Barely passable and again just plain. I had the 3 pork chops, Chuletas was the dish name, marinated overnight in a secret sauce. Don't bother, chops dried out and the sauces only secret is that it smothered the pork chops in something I would only describe as tasteless.\n\nThe service here was excellent (besides 3 requests for water) and can't fault them in this regard. Almost all the people in their, both small and large parties seemed to be celebrating a birthday party and it was just way to loud. WARNING sign - they listed fish on the menu but all they had were shrimp. This leads me to believe they do not shop fresh produce, how can you not have fish tacos on the menu!!! Come on and yes this only dawned on me after.\n\nWe finished our meal and probably returned the food about 75 - 80% untouched. There was an apology from the waiter but no manager to come and ask why, no credit on the bill... NOTHING.\n\nWe left our tip and were out of there and likely to never return...$100 down the drain.\n\nI am rarely this bad when writing reviews but when you have options like Mundos in town and Don Juan for texmex/fresh food then I would recommend you steering clear of this over rated Mexican establishment.\n\nSorry Lindo...",145130

But for fresh ingredients, good service and a gourmet selection, I would go back on occasion or maybe for a happy hour or meal deal. \n\nVery good.",189904

1,This place is simply confusing! And not in a good way. It's a nice place but it does not define itself at all. The menu includes breakfasr items but no lunch items and it does not have typical bar food either. No chicken wings yet there are tvs all over the place setting up the place to be a typical bar. It tries to be a wine bar but the wine list is very limited. We ordered the ordinary nachos which were decent and I also had the grilled  chicken sandwich which I ended up just eating the  chicken breast.  we went on a weekday so it might be different on the weekend but if u want a wine bar or a regular bar or a place to have a nice meal there are better options. the owners need to figure out what their concept is because it just left us confused and frustrated.,447201
3,My favorite bar in Vegas is firefly! The food and drinks are DELICIOUS! My only problem is they don't offer any industry discounts! My friends and I always debate Firefly or Blue Martini and we usually end up at Blue for the 40% off drinks with a work badge. Come on Firefly step it up a bit! A small discount goes a long way ;),606963
1,"For all the hype this place did not live up to my expectations. The service was good but the kitchen clearly lost our order as the table that was seated 20 minutes after us received their entrees before we did (both tables ordered sandwiches). In the end the wait was not worth it as I only finished half my sandwich and fries. There are excellent places to eat in Vegas, however this is not one of them.",461199
3,"Mm, I'd like to give it 3.5 stars.  \n\nBacchanal Buffet is in Ceasar's Palace, beyond the casino and near the desserts cafe. You can't miss it, it's where the HUGE line is.  We must have gotten there by 12pm and didn't get seated for another 1hour and 40 minutes.  line was crazy.  We got there and ordered the bottomless mimosas, which end at 3pm. We paid about $41.99 for Sunday's lunch.  \n\nThere was a good variety of food there. There's asian foods in the back (sushi, peking duck, ramen, udon noodle soup, etc), then cheese and charcuterie, pizza and pasta (the meatballs were really good), then there's your mexican/latino station (it's more like a taco station), BBQ station (some were really dry. I got the ribeye and that was juicy but really fatty), french fries and tator tots (sweet potatoe tots were really good), then lastly, your seafood station. The seafood station had snow crabs, oysters, and shrimp. I wanted to see some more stuff like lobster tails, maybe steamed mussels, but none of those were available.  \n\nSalad station was limited but I liked the garbanzo salad and the japanese seaweed salad.  \n\nDessert station was AWESOME. get the lava chocolate chip cookie, mochi ice creams, and coconut macaroons. So good. We also got a ice cream cone on the way out of the buffet.  I highly recommend it, it was a good experience and worth the wait.",570054
1,"We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say, the best part was the complimentary valet parking!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm, thinking the restaurant would be packed, only to find it about a quarter full.  Did we go to the right place?  From what I had heard, I expected there to be a line out the door like there was both times we went to Chima for past Restaurant Weeks.  It's a nice looking place, very open yet cozy, and it has a great bar area.  The server, John, was great and took good care of us, so no complaints there.  It was the food that was lackluster, and for the money, I wish we had gone elsewhere.  The bread was fresh and a good start (2 kinds, and a spread with olives as well as an oil and balsamic vinaigrette to wet it down). The Fattouch salads were good, though I question the use of iceberg lettuce for presentation as it looked like a low end salad with some red peppers, olives and a nasty tomato thrown in.  My partner had a Flat Iron Steak which he ordered medium well and got medium rare.  The first few bites were good, but it toughened as it cooled, and he had some difficulty cutting it as well as the asian broccoli (which he gave up on).  Being a vegan, I wasn't sure I would find anything to eat, but i did see a Mushroom Bolognese pasta dish that I ended up ordering.  It had a great taste, but the homemade pasta was a bit al dente and stuck together.  More like the wide rice noodles in some asian dishes.  Still, I enjoyed mine.  No vegan desert option for me (fresh fruit option, please?), but my partner ordered the chocolate cake and said it was good but very rich.  It all seemed to disappear, though, so that says something!  Overall, a decent dining experience, if we were spending maybe $40-50 max, tip included.  $30 each plus 2 iced teas ($6.98) and tip came to just under $90.  At least I felt like I got my one's worth with the valet at $5 for a tip, it saved me $1 off parking myself and then walking a block!  Still, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  With all the great dining our city has, I think there are better choices for the money...Ilios Noche comes to mind for great atmosphere, service and menu selection at about $20-25 less, and then we could still catch a movie!",7016
2,Me and the hubby came here for a quick dinner after hitting ToysRUs.\nHe got a sirloin & baked potato. It came with a side of grilled veggies that were a bit soggy. He loved the rest of the meal tho.\nI ordered a new item on the menu..fajitas!\nChicken & steak combo for 11 bucks!\nThey came out sizzling on a bed of rice with lottsa onions & peppers.\nIt was such a huge portion..big enough to have shared!\nThe server was a bit on the slow side. My iced tea was empty for half of my meal...glad I had water cuz those fajitas were hot!\nI took off a star for that..normally I wouldnt but he was checking on all the other tables around us..but not us.,56264
2,"Very loud, and overwhelming environment.  Personally I found it rather stressful, I guess it depends on your tastes.  The food was reasonably priced and tasty.  A good place to take kids, since the noise would easily drown out any tantrums they might throw.  I guess that is a positive, right?",590872
2,"Good place to dine while in the Phoenix airport. The service is friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and the food is good. I ordered the grilled chicken stuffed pita with lettuce, tomato, hummus, and a vinaigrette. There are plugins too. Can't beat that.",506123
0,"I Love dive bars but this one has gotten me questioning the whole concept of it. Firstly it had a cover charge.. Fine it was supposed to have 3 live bands and I understand that we need to pay to see them. THe last band did not show up. WTF!!! they should have told me that at the door. The band that was playing was more interested in fornicating with one groupie that was there. We had to hear a whole monologue from each of the band memebers about how they deserved a dollar stuffed in their whiteys which was fine as long as they actually played a song but nooooo... we will not play until we get a dollar stuffed down our small weenies. \""Then I will give a lap dance to the groupie and still not play\"". \n\nGreat!! and I had to be there to waste my time and money to observe this. Then I hear the last group ain't here. So I basically paid a cover charge to see drunk band members hit on groupies.\n\n And lets not talk about the turd they served me as bar food. The grilled chicken burger turned out to be raw and the soup was well... bleech....\n\nWhy oh why do I subject myself to this mishandling... oh right I like dive bars, food joints etc.... because I believe mom and pop type establishments try their best to serve people well.....\n\nParadigm shift with this establishment... service was apathetic.. food well.... grungy... and music..... blase....\n\nTruly a disappointment to my core beliefs",33695
4,"Visiting from NY, we actually found this highly-rated restaurant on Yelp ... and we were certainly not disappointed! It's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. A real VIP treatment.  \nFor starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. Many of the others sounded great too.  Our daughter, who is at college here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  All fantastic! Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love to hear about it.  We will definitely be back!",989
2,Overall good food. I really enjoy the Bacon Double Dell Burger and chicken soft tacos.,433182
3,"Fun place to chill with a lot of friends and I really like the outdoors patio.  This is a good starting spot in Vegas.  The food wasn't great, but I guess that's not the point.  \n\nIf you go, try to sit on the patio on the 3rd floor.  It is less crowded than downstairs and has a cooler atmosphere.",187424
2,"Think of the Sugar Factory as a beddazzled Cheesecake Factory on steroids. It's got a large menu with just about everything on it. But, I can't tell you if it's good or bad because I only stopped by for a couple sweet treats with the family.\n\nThis place is actually broken up into four sections. The Sugar Factory American Brasserie is for dining, either indoors or on their patio overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountains. The Sugar Factory Chocolate Lounge is a more intimate space with sweets and drinks. The Outdoor Caf\u00e9, located right on the Strip, is a small outdoor counter serving up sandwiches, ice cream, gelato and other sweets. Finally, the Sugar Factory retail shop is the place to get sweets and merchandise (similar to their other shops around the Strip).\n\nThe retail shop was sensory overload -- not only with the desserts, cookies, ice cream, and gelato, but also with all the crap, I mean merchandise, to buy. Plus, the place was packed with tourists. Not the place to be if you hate crowds (as I do). We purchased three items (for around $12) and found a small, quiet 4 seat counter near the Chocolate Lounge to relax.\n\nThe wife got a peanut butter cookie that she called average (and not enough peanut butter). The kid got a small cup of chocolate ice cream, which he loved. He's 3, so of course he wasn't picky about his ice cream.\n\nI went with a key lime cupwich. It's a great -- albeit old -- concept that I'm surprised hasn't caught on with more cupcake shops. They take the bottom half of the cake portion of the cupcake and put it on top of the icing, making a sandwich. I'm a huge fan of the concept. Their version allows for a better icing-to-cake ratio and is easier to eat than most cupcakes. It looked beautiful with additional icing garnishing the top, along with a sugar-made flower and some sprinkles. It had a strong key lime flavor without being too tart. Unfortunately, the cake part was dry. \n\nI'd possibly come back to try other sweets. Maybe even the food. But, if you just want desserts I'd recommend heading to Jean Philippe Patisserie at Aria or Bellagio before this place.",504446
1,"6 of us went to Binks Midtown on friday night for a friend's birthday dinner. I would give the ambiance and food a 4 or 5 but the service was quite poor. My friend touched the bread serving dish and burned her hand so badly her fingers blistered. There was No warning about the temperature of the serving plate and there were  no apologies for her sizzling fingers either. She asked for ice to stop the pain and had to repeat the request 4 more times to 3 different people to get a simple ice-cube - which finally appeared about 15 minutes after she was burned.  \nThey knew ahead of time that it was a birthday for one of our group and there was not even a cupcake or a happy birthday wish from our server.\nAppetizers were brought out one at a time and out of sequence so  some of us were nearly done while others had yet to receive their starters.\nThe server seemed unaware of the use of \""please\"" or \""thank-you\""\nEvery request had to be made 3 or 4 times - everything was so slow it spoiled the experience. \nAs I said, the food was special but the service was so poor, I will not recommend it nor will I return.",599154

3,"First of all, excellent name. Not a clue where it comes from, but it is wonderful.\n\nThis is a solid place to see a show. I was here for the Fringe and saw a few things throughout the weekend here. All of them comfortable, great sound, lots of fun. The only issue it really has against it is it's a maze. Trying to get anywhere in here is a journey. They do their best at labelling and putting up signs, but I think I still had to ask someone each time I wanted to get anywhere.\n\nBut it's a slight price to say for an excellent show venue. Got a chance to see something here? See it.",357503

Great selection, even got a ride back to our hotel in a Hummer (a real one, not a luxury one!). Very friendly and helpful staff. Lots of fun and would do it again!",563375

0,I went for a nice meal tonight and wound up with a rather bad experience. I first sat in the bar and got a drink. After watching the bartender cater to a group of five while I sat alone and waited 10 minutes for a menu I decided to sit somewhere else in the main dining room.  Kevin then served me. Everything was fine until a party of eight showed up and then he could care less about me and did not show up but once every 20 minutes. Of course when he did come by he wanted to know if I wanted another $20 glass of wine to pump up the bill.  Stay away from this place because the servers just want to make their money on the big parties. And my tip to Kevin showed it. I have been known to tip a lot. Usually 50%. But not tonight and I will not go back. Typical West Coast environment. Short term,190521

Seemed like undercooked beef fat,all gelatinous. heh heh,gross.\n-never got water refills and I was really thirsty...hubby got offered a soda refill in our last five minutes \n-no mac n cheese bar, french macaroons, mini candied/choc covered apples, or egg-cream-things that night\n\nHere's the pros,hope I don't miss any:\n+I love the individual pots of foods\n+there are automated wine stations, which I'm still not quite sure how to use, some kind of card was needed, which was never offered to me at any time...anyway, there are 8 bottles in there and you can get a full ($10), half($5), or quarter($2) pour of any of them\n+the water comes in big beautiful corked bottles and tastes really good\n+my fav foods: gnocchi with asiago cheese and lamb sauce!!!!, shrimp and grits, white clam pizza (I had 2), truffle potatoes gratin, mac n cheese, THE CHEESE PLATE, arugala salad, mango parfait, passion fruit fudge, fatass choc covered strawberries...so pretty much everything I grabbed was stellar\n+gorgeous scenery\n+Hubby put this at the top of his buffet list\n\nSo even after the given trouble the night before, this place did exceed my expectations. I would most certainly be back,as soon as possible, and I am now having a real hard time deciding who is my top buffet: Wicked spoon, Bellagio buffet, or buffet at M resort. They all have their incredible features, but given the price and value, I may say Wicked Spoon.",492017

Their croissants (especially pain au chocolat) are truly five-star and the rest of the food is generally good but I'm still quite wary of the staff.",306925
1,"I should have walked a bit further some more bad mall food.\n\nThe food is reminiscent of Denny's burgers. Actually, I take that back, Denny's is probably better. It was nothing spectacular but what made my experience and EWWW was that I opted for a seat at the counter, where I could watch the food being prepared. Bad idea.\n\nEverything was dipped in butter before hitting the hot griddle also, I couldn't help but notice the filthy supposed-to-be-white uniforms everyone was wearing. Inmates have cleaner clothes.\n\nBecause this was in a mall, it was extremely busy and it took a while before the food made its way to us and even getting a refill was difficult. \n\nI do like the 50s music and liked singing along obnoxiously. I felt bad for the servers when they had to dance/perform for the patrons. You could tell that they hated it and it was not worth the $3/hr to work here.",48625

3,"We went to the \""friends and family\"" opening of Maverick Rock Taco tonight and I must say, I can't wait to go back to try the regular menu.  Tonight, they had an assortment of chips and salsas and guacamole. In addition, they had shrimp skewers, chicken wings, sliders, and sausages.  I am not a huge fan of chicken wings, but theirs were really good.  I also loved the pineapple-mango salsa. Delish!  To go along with the light bites, they were serving up various Mexican beers and yummy white sangria. They also had a DJ spinning actual vinyl... too cool!",565881
1,"First things first, let's talk about the ONLY reason to (in my not so humble opinion) visit this restaurant...  Fried Chicken!  It's good.  No, It's really, really good.  If you need something tasty along with it, try the zucchini fries.  They're good, too and the dipping sauce is perfect.   \n\nAnd there ends my praise for the Fox.  Sadly, everything else I have tried on the menu has been bland, or just fallen short of my expectations.\n\nI've tried the catfish, the fried steak, the BLT, and several other things.  Everything tastes like they're out of seasoning.  After my last visit, I won't be back.  There's just too many other great options.

2,"I've been to this place plenty of times before, & every time I've been here, I would definitely give 5 stars. I gave 3 stars because our server Scheila, was just completely horrible last night. I had an iced tea that didn't get offered to be refilled once. She kept refilling our waters but didn't ask at all if I wanted more iced tea. Of course I had to ask for it... I don't know if you pay by the glass for iced tea at this resturant but it would still be a little nice for her to ask. I don't think she even asked if we were doing ok the whole time we were sitting! The meat of course was beyond amazing. The lobster bisque is what I look forward to every time I'm headed here, if you haven't had it, you need to try it. It is one of the best soups I've ever had! Not exaggerating. We wanted more of the fried bananas and it felt like we had to hunt down our server for more. After all the food we had no idea where the waitress, so it was like an hour until we got our check. This is the first time we had a discount here, it was something like a buy one get one free coupon. Thank goodness we had that or else I would of been a little disappointed spending full price on the service we got. I'm thinking this whole bad service thing is because we were sitting in the corner, right next to her drink stand. But at the same time, you'd think she would come to the drink stand more often & see us. I'm not sure. I will definitely be back to this resturant because I love it so much, I will just remember not to ask for her.",347680

Great live German music and an excellent outdoor seating area.\n\nAnd beer in 32oz steins.  Gotta love that!",214872
1,"This place looked very promising from the menu and the decor.  I typically enjoy any Fox restaurant, however, this restaurant is a gimmick.  \n\nI ordered the free range half chicken.  I really enjoy this dish at most restaurants, but I was disappointed.  The chicken seemed to be low quality, and was very fatty.  The iced tea was good though.\n\nIf you are vegan or have a food allergy, this restaurant will be great for you.  However, otherwise, you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan label that lacks flavor.  If you are looking for this option, then try it, but otherwise, I would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price.    \n\nJust mediocre.  And way overpriced.",485915
0,it was hella dumb. i hated this experience. i wish i got my money back and the two hours i spent in line to get in. it was not scary fun or worth it. i didn't go in gates of hell bc of all the bad reviews but i did go in the other two houses. i won't be coming back to any of their haunted houses ever again.  and the owner or watever of this place brought in all his friends to cut in line in front of us all who had been waiting.  he had his buddies comin in n out. never coming back.,531005
3,"Saw all the great reviews on Yelp and had to try this place. We were very happy we did! So close to home and love the neighborhood pizzeria feel. Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage and garlic, 3 cheese Stromboli and garlic knots....OMG the garlic knots!!! They were fluffy pillows of buttery, garlicky goodness that not only smelled good but made our mouths water as their wonderful aroma filled the air around us. The pizza was BETTER than the NYC pizza I had in NYC and made me feel good knowing I don't have to travel 3000 miles to get amazing pizza. The crust was thin, crisp and chewy, sauce was perfect, cheese is good quality and toppings very generous. We will definitely be back and spread the word. Thanks to Yelp we saved 50% off our pizza order just for checking in today between 2-5pm.",553177
2,"The food is good, the service is okay. \n\nIt's good if you want some cheap food that isn't terrible, but in the area I think there is definitley some better mexican good. \n\nI don't like the chicken they use, so I try to avoid anything with that on their menu!",22819
3,"The atmosphere is beautiful in here- and this is why you should come.  Whomever designed this restaurant derserves a big kudos.  I love the lighting, the tile, and the glass ceiling by the patio.  I love how you can see the Bellagio fountains from the patio-so perfect, and how they remember to keep you warm here with their patio heaters. :)\n\n  It loses a star because the food taste just \""average\"" to me.  I've been here twice.  Once I got an apple salad that left me still hungry (I think it's meant of more of an appetizer than an entree), the other time I got the Classique steak (my husband and I share the appetizers of the mac&cheese, and sweet potato soup), everything was \""just okay.\""  Big portions but ordinary tastes.  \n\nThe bread was amazing through, and bread is important to me!  The warm bagette with carrot dressing (sounds gross but trust me, it was fantastic).  I might try this place for breakfast sometime after reading the reviews here.",167530
1,"Okay this was my second trip to Global --the first being 3 years ago and the last tonight. We were greeted by a uppity hostess ..who acted like we could not be seated or taken care of..I understand --we DID NOT have a reservation, but it was a Tuesday Night and it was 6 PM and No one was there....no one other than myself and the waiters. She did say she would try and I went to the restroom and came back out and she ..said..POSSIBLY we could sit at the bar...So we took it..a party of three...and we were happy to be there--it just sets the mood when the people that own the restaurant where YOU are going to spend YOUR MONEY and they act indifferent to you..\nWe started out with a bottle of BOOM BOOM Sirah..it was good. We ordered 3 appetizers...the Mediterranean Lamb, the Berkshire Pork Belly, and Butternut Squash  Soup.   Soup was good..Pork Belly can do no wrong..EVER and the Lamb...not quite good and way to tough and well done.\nWe then ordered the Sea Bass and the Open Raviolio. The Open Raviolio had way to much canned tomatoes, zucchini and wet veggies...not really there. The Sea Bass looked beautiful..the top 1/2 inch was edible the rest..was a tough gelatinous piece of sea carcass. NOT able to cut or eat. They did take it off the menu..\nThe waiter ( Chris) was very good ...he was the bright light of the restaurant...\nThe restaurant..was ALMOST GOOD..Not quite..not worth another trip back..Oh yea and it was very high priced for a Not Great place....",345018
3,"I was just visiting Pittsburgh and I never been to the city before so I came here because everyone said that Primanti Brothers is a rite of passage.  So I went.\n\nHISTORY:  The original one is located in the Pittsburgh Strip District, a really busy area along with the Allegheny River which are dotted with warehouses and produce yards.  The owner, Joe Primanti, invented his famous sandwich during the Great Depression.  This spawned all kinds of sandwiches and the restaurant became a stop for late-night and early-morning workers.  For decades, it was a big food stop for truck drivers. Because they usually had to get their burgers or sandwiches to go, the restaurant started putting the fries inside the burgers and sandwiches so they can eat their entire meal with ease while driving. That eventually became their signature piece for all their sandwiches. Even though it's an eatery for all and is a foodery stop for everyone crazy about the Burgh, the original Primantis still keeps it's super large parking lot for truck drivers to make their routine stop for food. Pittsburgh is a working class city who loves (LOVES) their sports so Primanti Brothers is an insanely popular place to pre or post-game or to game-game while eating and drinking. It's now a chain that is all throughout the east coast but in Pittsburgh it's a staple.  Whenever TV stations (notably ESPN) do an expose on the city, Primanti Brothers is always mentioned, visited and spotlighted.\n\nFOOD: Heavy. They put their fries inside their burger. Um, I guess that's a novelty but conceptually it's like a turducken. Kind of too much.  But excess is the theme of all their signature burgers and sandwiches or you can custom-make your excess.  Add more fries, sauces, an egg, double up on meat, combine different kinds of meat.  Mention the word diet and everyone will look at you as if you're from California, which in this case, is true. But the restaurant, per their menu, states that their sandwiches are only the number 2 favorite.  The title of number one favorite goes to beer.  Not a particular kind.  Just beer in general.  Smile.\n\nSERVICE: Incredibly friendly and they love the question \""What's your favorite?\"" to which the answer will, again, be beer.  Another smile.  Tell them you're new and just visiting Pittsburgh, they'll relish the opportunity to fill you in on not just the favorites of the menu but their personal favorites in the city at large.\n\nCONSENSUS:  Definitely not a place to eat if you're dieting, paleo or vegan unless it's a cheat day or you relapse into the world of meat.  But if you can appreciate the hearty sports bar fanfare, you'll find yourself at home here with your stomachs full.  The restaurant, itself, is very welcoming and the bar area is incredibly social, especially if there is a game playing.  As a visiter of the city as a whole, I don't know if this is characteristic to the restaurant or the city as a whole, but, regardless, I will swing by again when I have business in Pittsburg in the future.  I'll just make sure that it is also a cheat day.",471072
3,"I didn't come here to shop, so I didn't get a chance to look through their items.  I came here to sell some of my daughter's old clothes.  I came in with 2 black bags of clothes and was told I could only bring in 1 bag and it had to be a white one.  Kind of weird and inconvenient since I didn't want to come back for a second time just to bring back the same bag.  Other than that, I can't really complain since they are buying my hand me downs.",72091
1,"Where to start.... I used to shop here a LOT and still do sometimes (due to it being so close to my home), but the place is well below the standards that every other Walmart seems to have. I have read Made in America (Sam Walton's autobiography), and he would roll over in his grave to see this location.\n\nI would like to note first and foremost that the Pharmacy always gives excellent, consistent quality service. \n\nWe have had two cars damaged just from simple oil changes here (I know, partially our fault for going back). One they stripped the threads on something requiring a trip a to an ACTUAL car repair shop (where we should have gone in the first place), the other they simply didn't put the oil cap back on and I realized it after about 20 miles of freeway driving when the engine gave me trouble, smelt like burnt oil and when I opened up the hood it was EVERYWHERE. They told me they reviewed the tape and their oil change guy (I hesitate to use the word mechanic) did nothing wrong. I was also told the manager would call me after talking to an assistant manager, however, this never happened. This bugs me more than anything else, even the damage to the vehicles. I don't know if it was a mistake on the assistant managers part or if the stores general manager just didn't want to talk to me, but it is absolutely inexcusable from any angle with a company that (usually) has as good of customer service as Walmart does.\n\nAlso, many things are consistently not stocked if you go in the evening. I know they only stock overnight, but I don't understand how they can so consistently not realize that certain items simply need more stock on the shelves. \n\nEmployees often smoke immediately outside the front doors close to closing time so  you can't avoid the smoke.\n\nDefinitely the second worst Wal-Mart I have ever patronized. \n\nOn the bright side, the frustration with this location has made me realize how much better, cleaner and competitively priced the Safeway down the street is!",102008
4,"Quite possibly the most awesome place I've ever lived or even been to, and I've been around....",157863

4,"This place was easily the best place I've eaten at in Vegas. It's located in the Bellagio, not too far out of the casino. Me and a friend had a table right by the water, while the water show was going on. It was the coolest table-side entertainment I'd ever had. Steak was terrific, as were the sides. If you've got the money, try it out.",191744
2,"Had our 6 month check up yesterday and it was just ok. The ladies at the front reception are still unfriendly and will actually take phone calls while you are standing right in front of them...even if they were talking to you first. \n\nThe medial technicians don't actually talk TO my baby but will tell me how cute he is and talk to me about him. It would be nice if she interacted with him. She wouldn't even touch him until she had to give him his shots and even then, she didn't actually speak to him. \n\nThey still call me \""Mom\"" even though I've corrected them and asked them to call me by my name. Again, I'm not YOUR Mom and when I've asked you to address me by my name and you still don't, it's obvious that you don't really care about my business. \n\nDr. Pham is great though and does listen but I think this will be our last visit.",117670
0,"Wow. Terrible service last night.  We were seated at our table for 40 minutes without a single glass of water. We had finally gotten our drinks 30 minutes in. The two plates of bread they brought out for the table of 15 were long gone and we hadn't ordered any food yet so we asked for the manager.  His rude and defensive response has to be one of the worst I've ever witnessed.  My brother was so annoyed he asked the guy to walk away.  When the food arrived it was sub par.  It certainly wasn't as good as it used to be.  The Mac n cheese was dry and flavorless, our meatballs were bland, we got about half as many padron peppers as we used to.  My shrimp ceviche was served on a different plate then it used to be leaving my tortilla chips to sit in the juice and become soggy.  Thank goodness we had the best company and we were able to laugh and still enjoy the night.  I will not be back...ever",555432
4,"Oh. My. God. \n\nCan this place really be real? The food here is absolutely INCREDIBLE! So delicious with EXTRA LARGE portions...like, share with a friend. Seriously. We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles and both dishes were to die for. Bacon strips placed inside of waffles?! How can you not be ok with that?? Bes thing ever. No complaints just super full bellies and an awkward waddle out the door. We had a 45 minute wait to be seated for a party of 5 but we just headed to O'Shea's downstairs to pass the time. Went by pretty quick and definitely worth the wait. The place is open 24 hours which is also a cool touch as it makes for great drunk and/or hungover food. Or just good food in general. Oh and don't forget to try the BLT Bloody Mary!!",427563
4,Pizza is really good and hot wings are too. Service has always been good girls have never been rude good customer service. We usually order a Hawaiian a couple days ago we found out it actually comes with pizza sauce and bar b que on it which was so gross. It was just one time the employee didn't ask but now we know and it has been great! Fast service and delivery good hours and location nice parking!,474126
3,I am in love with the whimsical opulence in the decor. I adore visiting for this very reason! My husband and I visited during lunch and the menu is more reasonably priced. The burgers are outstanding and almost overwhelm you with the sheer size!,408794
1,"Service was fine - I sat at the bar.\nPartially this might be my mistake - i came here for late lunch.  I wasn't sure if I was into having an 8oz burger (ie the big bun) so I decided to go for the tiny buns (3 sliders per serve).\n\n2nd mistake - I ordered something other than a beef patty (pretty obvious this is a beef place).  I ordered the Ahi sliders.\n\nSo yes maybe other choices would have been better.  But for a place with burgers as main attraction as a burger?  The slider buns were very disappointing - cold and hard.  The Ahi had a spicy herb crust on the outside and tasted decent (nothing to rave about), the cucumber and slaw under the quartered piece of Ahi were actually in my opinion the highlight.  In fact I would have paid for that to be an Ahi cucumber salad much more happily.\n\nSweet potato fries I added were decent - but again not really memorable.\n\nThe redeeming thing?  The margarita I ordered was very nice.",490049
0,"The first time I went we had a big group and plenty of conversation so we didn't really mind the slow service.  The flat breads were all great as were the tacos.  The pulled pork sliders were a little weak, but the food was very good overall.  The second time the horrible service reared its ugly head.  My girlfriend and I sat down and just under 20 minutes went by and no waiter came to see us.  The one guy I saw was absurdly overworked.  The poor kid seemed to have 10 tables and was bussing his own tables as well.  When we left the manager seemed genuinely apologetic and tried to offer us an appetizer.  I just can't give my business to a place like this when there are plenty of restaurants in the city that are hustling to earn our business.  I like the food, but the atrociously slow service is too much to bear.",497319
0,"ummm if you want a good burger go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood across the street.\n\nWe stayed at the Mirage and there always seemed to be a line for BLT, it was convenient so we thought we would give it a go. Well the service was crap, the waitress never came by barely spoke to us......  I got the Tex Mex burger and it was like dripping in sweet BBQ sauce, gross..... not very good at all, I had two bites..... We also tried the nacho basket, just a soggy mess of more sweet BBQ over chips..... I am from South Texas and like my shit hot! So maybe I am just spoiled by good nachos.... who knows but if you are excepting good food stay away, if you don't really care then go for it.... You'll be wasting $100 for two people..... But maybe you are rich and don't care.  I blame this restaurant for giving me the worst hangover ever.... Thanks a lot Obama!",325944
1,"We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average; your basic bar food, some with a Cajun flair.  From the grungy feel of the restaurant, I wouldn't want to experiment too much with food here, especially where seafood is concerned.  \n\nIf you're in college, like to party, and in your early to mid-twenties, Dixie's may seem like a cool hangout place.  If you're anything else, there are better options in Uptown.",6645
2,Went here on a Sunday morning around 9am.  Had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Had a steady flow of people showing up so the place was busy.  \n\nThe food was average for breakfast.  I had the chicken fried steak with eggs and hash browns.  My wife had the biscuits with gravy.  Both portions were big so they get an extra star for that.  The hash browns good and the biscuits tasted home made. \n\nI took 2 stars away for the seating. We sat right next to the kitchen door.  \n\nService was good.  Drinks came right away and the food didn't take long either.   The waitress was very nice and checked on us a couple times.,592556

3,"Tried Bombay Spice last night. After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts!\n\nIt was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!). \n\n Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations. \n\nWe ordered:\nSomosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty).\nNaan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum)\nGrilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).\n\nWe each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. \n\nI ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).\n\nHusband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home. \n\nNext time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things. \n\n$35 before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. We'll definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us.",320246
0,"Is there a way to give negative stars?  We chose this place because it seemed like a nice quiet place to chill and talk.  At first, that's exactly what we got.  Our server was pleasant and quick with the drinks.  She left about 15 minutes after we sat down, however, and things turned awful.\n\nWe were harassed by 3 different homeless people for money.  Granted, it's not Fitzgerald's fault that homeless people come up to people sitting on their patio. However, they didn't take an active role in getting the homeless people to leave until one actually went into the bar.  They care about themselves not being bothered and not the customers sitting on the patio.\n\nAround 1am we were told it was last call and asked by a bartender if we wanted another drink.  By 1:10 our tabs were all closed but we remained on the patio talking and finishing our last call drinks. As with all drinking, we took turns going into the bar to use the restroom.  At 1:30am we were told that we couldn't go in and out of the bar (even to use the restroom).  At 1:45 we were told by a bartender that the bar closes at 1:30 and the sign in the window and google (which both say the bar closes at 2am) haven't been right \""for a long time.\"" The entire time this was going on, the bartenders were sitting inside at the bar with a \""friend\"" watching us. They were rude every time we used the restroom. They were rude about us being on the patio.  They were rude about picking up our glassware from the patio. At 1:55am they apparently got sick of waiting for us to leave and we watched as the bartenders ran up the street with the friend they were sitting at the bar with to make last call at another bar (which they told us they wanted to do earlier in the night).  The staff here do not care about this place or the perception their actions leave with the customers.  I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out $100 bills with every beer (which was only slightly above room temperature btw). There are far too many better options uptown to waste your time at a place that does not care about your business.",540816

2,"Good food and service but wanted a nice dinner. in a restaurant where I feel like I'm eating with the people next to me we are so close, I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as we couldn't even hear our own conversation. Pretty to see the fountains but if I'm gonna pay that kind of money, I want the matching ambiance not the feeling of being packed in for monetary ends",174164
2,"I have very mixed views on Bartolotta... \n\nI don't like the restaurant itself, like most things Wynn touches, it's overdone and gaudy...lacking any semblance of taste, simplicity, tact and sophistication. \n\nI'm also not a fan of the overcomplicated corkage fee process...Not allowing wines on their wine list, and  basically hiking the price and try to make you think you're getting your money's worth because they chill your wine to your liking, etc. \n\nThe wine list is a joke... and displays a real audacity. It takes balls to charge $10 for a glass of $7 \""sparkling\"" wine(Zardetto Veneto)! Or $15 for a glass of house wine that's worth $18 a bottle(Abbazia di Novacello)...Their \""better\"" selections aren't really all that much better, $42 for a glass of $70 wine(Brigaldara Amarone della Valpolicella Classico DOCG)... But as usual, they get away with it because the majority of people are not familiar with wines. I'm not singling Bartolotta out on this, almost all restaurants and even wine bars, do it.\n\n I also think the whole gimmick of having people buy an entire fish is ridiculous. You're looking at $200 or more for a fish that was caught in some of Europe's dirtiest waters.... although they've made a lot of strides over the last decade...  \n\nAnd...I also wouldn't recommend the tasting menu, here or anywhere else...namely for the fact that when I go out to eat, I want a meal...and a tasting menu is... Well, it is exactly what it says it is....and it's not very pragmatic.\n\nSo why three stars you might ask? \n\nThe pasta dishes are really good...you can request an entree size portion at double the appetizer price. It's pricy, but given the quality of the ingredients, authenticity of the preparation, and the fact that you won't find these dishes at many other places...if at any, it town, I'd say it's worth it.  With appetizers, entrees and corkage fee, two people can have an excellent, fine dining(at least as far as the food is concerned) experience for around $150. Which isn't bad considering...\n\nThe insalata di piovra Ligure always consists of tender squid and the wine-vinegar-olive oil ratio is perfect... and the rabbit loin with artichoke hearts and balsamic vinegar is addictive.\n\nThe  lasagnette con ragu di crostacei and the spaghetti all'astice both use quality seafood...the flavors and textures are perfectly balanced.\n\nThe  maccheroni with the rag\u00f9 Toscano and the agnolotti al plin are also good choices. The Tuscan ragu is rich and flavorful...quality ingredients are used. While the agnolotti meat filling is perfectly flavored. Simple dishes like this require top quality ingredients, and Bartolotta definitely uses them. \n\nIt can seem hard to do, but... forget the pretension, the gaudiness, the faux-fistication, and savor a taste of Italy...",180784

Our server, Joe (\""hey-guy\"") was one of the best servers we've had in a long while!  He offered suggestions and we ended up with the NW Pub Burger with salad and blue cheese dressing and the Kobe Beef Burger with fries.  Both were awesome and the Pub Burger is to die for!!!  During our meal, Rene (a manager) came over to ask how we were doing.  We told him we were first-timers.

As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly. \n\nIt has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.\n\nHowever, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds.

3,I am commenting on the super Bi-lo in Matthews on Fincher Farm lane.  The managers and sales staff are quite friendly and do go out of their way to assist you. They recently overcharged me on an item that was still advertised as buy one get one free but they made good and refunded all the  money plus I got to keep the item. Can't complain about that. I wish they did offer more gourmet items as Harris Teeter does but I like the shopping experience there and they do have good deals on lots of items that I buy frequently. That is why I keep going back.,420184
4,This place is great! The only downside is that it is 40 minutes from my house. I wish it was closer. Really nice and affordable outdoor range. The people there are really friendly.,441200

0,"terrible service!  the only advantage of this liquor store is it's close to the strip.  I went there to buy some liquor on a friday night and after I left the store, I couldn't find my phone.  So I called my cellphone to see if it's somewhere in my car.  The phone wasn't shut off and it wasn't in my car.  So I decided to call back the liquor store.  the person said they didn't find any phone.  Then I asked if I can come back and check myself.  The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.  And just to be fair to them, I clearly remembered talking on the phone with one of my friends before heading over to the liquor store.  So the chance that I lost my phone in the liquor store is very highly! On top of that, the liquor is ghetto as hell and doesn't have plastic cup for customers.  What kinda of a liquor store is it if it doesn't even have cups?\nDon't go there if you don't want to lose your phone !",65640
0,"Can I give negative stars? \nMy boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said \""here's your check please pay and leave.\"" I said \""Excuse me\"" and he responded \""You are a waste of space at my bar.\"" I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded \""are you serious?\"" All he said was \""Leave\"" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, \""Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway.\"" As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said \""I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!\"" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out?

Located in the same center as Bachi Burger but way on the other side. Its a pretty small, clean pizzeria, holds about 10 people maybe more, with a flat screen and some happy pics of who is probably Mama Cimino on one wall and a mural on another wall. \n\nMy sausage calzone was larger then any other I've had a nice size and hot right out of the oven. Enough for tomorrow's lunch or tonight's snack. Came with some marinara sauce on the side, which was a little watery so just mixed in some parmesan and it was fine for me, some made from scratch ranch dressing not the processed stuff. I would have taken a pic but I was starving and already ate some of it. Order in advance because it took at least 20 mins. \n\nThey make Chicago style deep dish pizza, which is my favorite type of pizza so I'll probably come back for that, and the NY style pizza, their largest was huge I forget the measurements but it was only around $17. they have a good menu, calzones, strombolis, sandwiches, pizzas, wings, and at some decent prices. i think they also have some 5 and 10 foot long sandwiches. get back to you on that. \n\nSome of their by slice pizzas during lunch were old and dried up. so hopefully you catch it when it's fresh and right out of the oven.\n\nIf you like them on facebook you get 15% off.",384537

How many restaurants can be romantic and clubby at the same time?  Nove fits in well with The Palms.   \n\nThe food is fantastic.  I would recommend the starter of tomato soup and grilled cheese.  It's an interesting take on a classic item.  The portions are large so keep that in mind as you order.\n\nI had my birthday dinner here, and the host was so nice, and sent over a shot of champagne.  I had never really had a \""shot\"" of champagne before, but it was cute nonetheless.\n\nOur server, Joey, was dynamite.

0,"Nothing Joyful about it. Worst I've had in years. The restaurant is in a failing strip mall. No windows, dark and dingy and it smelled of Pine sol.  Staff did not greet us with a smile ( I can't blame them, maybe too depressed). We went at lunchtime and the place was empty - save for one table.  I ordered the Kung Pao as a safe bet. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the sauce was salty - tasted mostly like soy sauce. I thought maybe it was just me, so I took the rest home for my husband. He said it was \""inedible\"". Then I told him where I went and he said \""I could have told you that, that place is awful\"". \nMy friend ordered the Shrimp in Lobster sauce, she said it was ok, but she would never go back. The egg rolls were soggy and greasy and the fried rice was non nondescript. I have no idea why anyone would give this place 5 stars! I know it's been around a while - maybe they are regulars.",45920

After seeing so many positive reviews & recs on the place I knew I had to come back & refresh my memory of Mi Patio. \n\nMy dad & I came here for lunch this past Wednesday around noon. The parking lot was packed, that's always a good sign! I have to agree with Rand H, that the restaurant does have an odd shape to it. We were seated at a table that had a chair on one side & a booth on the other, I sat at the booth spot. Our table was kinda wobbly, definitely needed to stick a book or something under the table leg. \n\nChips & salsa were immediately brought out & soon after came our drink orders. The chips & salsa were pretty damn good & our server was very on top of refills. For our entrees: my dad ordered a bean & cheese burro & I ordered the baja spinach & feta cheese chimi, both came with a side of rice. Dad enjoyed his burro & ate about 3/4 of it, he didn't eat the rice though because he's more of a beans guys & is watching his carbs. I also enjoyed my chimi, very unique flavors, the rice was yummy & I finished it all. I had about half of my chimi left so I took it home to hubby, along with the rest of my dad's burro & his rice. Hubby said chimi was ok, rice was good & burro was his fav. \n\nMy next visit will for sure be sooner than a few years!",92689
2,"Sherwin Williams paint is great! We tried a regular home maintenance paint, but found out that Sherwin Williams paint is worth the price you pay. I've been here multiple times and there has always been one guy working the counter...which makes for a really long wait. They aren't very good at answering their phone too so don't bother calling because if its just that one guy working then he doesn't have time to answer. They have everything you need here to paint and their paint selection/colors is extensive. You can always choose to go with their low VOC paint, but I really couldn't tell the difference between the smells from when we painted one room with their low VOC to their regular paint. They also offer discounts from time to time, so I would check online or wait for their 30% off all paints and supplies!",149168
3,"I don't gamble, and if I do it's like $100. I'm the type of Asian guest that the Palazzo doesn't want, and they do cater to Asians since over 80% of the whales and hi-rollers are Asian. That's why you'll be properly accommodated if you want to watch Korean, Chinese, and Japanese TV shows (I hope they have Viet channels cuz Viets sure do throw down big money in Vegas).\n\nI only have some small issues with the Palazzo because after all, it's supposed to be a 5-star hotel?\n\nPROS:\n- Overall big spacious rooms (everybody's reviews below spells out the specifics).\n\nCONS:\n- The design of the Palazzo is very middle-of-the road, and it doesn't take the themed gimmick route like the Venetian, New York New York, Paris, Excalibur, etc. Instead, they've designed a fairly lackluster interior that's very forgettable. Even the lobby seems indistinctly tucked away into one side of the main rotunda which can be overlooked if you're not paying attention.\n- The management was gracious enough to let us check-in early since we got in prior to 3pm, but I don't know if room service would have put the finishing touch on everything, but I noticed a bunch of annoying details:\n  1. the lamp fixture in the bathroom was tilted, and it needed to be straightened out.\n  2. Small gripe, but when someobody's in the bathroom frantically spinning the toilet paper roll, you can hear it while your laying in the bed. This could take a toll on having \""sweet dreams\"".... I imagine dreams of trying to balance yourself atop a log while cruising down a river of chocolate... yea chocolate.\n  3. Design wise, the door knob they decided to use on the doors is deceiving because I had a friend say \""there's somebody in the bathroom\"" because they couldn't turn the handle thinking it was locked. Instead, you just have to pull on the door - either you're a moron, or it's intuitively ingrained in us to turn a handle. \n  4. Like the Se Hotel in San Diego, there's a gap in the bathroom door which is a huge perverted plus because they also don't have a lock on the doors. So if you have female guests, they'll have to barricade the doors if they can't trust you. My friend didn't shower.\n  5. It would have been nice to use the refrigerator in the room, but any sort of movement in the mini-bar would have resulted in additional room charges. Not to mention, the ice bucket they provide you is extremely tiny. \n  6. The bell check didn't bother helping us with any of our luggage when we drove up!?! They only assisted the people getting out of the taxi cabs. What's up with that? I know they don't offer valet, but isn't this the simplest thing they could do because it set the tone for the remainder of our stay.\n  7. Out of the 3 bathrooms, the bathroom TV wouldn't turn off, and it also didn't have the same channels as the other two?! So we couldn't find the shows we were watching on the other two.\n\nOverall it was a decent stay on NYE at the Palazzo because the rooms are so spacious which is great for hosting a bunch of your friends prior to going out. I bet Chinese New Year would be even better in Vegas. Maybe, I'll have to get a room number with 8's in it and take up gambling.... well Happy New Year!",292711

Both were excellent dogs, and their beer list is incredible.  \n\nAgain, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes off as real?  If they tried this in NYC or Boston, it would come off as a gimmick.  Whereas here, in Swissvale, it just seems like a neighborhood place with a twist.  A coronary twist.  So good.....",1562

3,"My Big Fat Fantastic Experience!  Yet again Jennica and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant have spoiled us like family!\n\nWe came in around 8-ish, the dining room was packed with a small wait.  We chose to enjoy the warm evening air on the misted patio.  It was perfect for our party of six, four adults and two children.  \n\nWe ordered our favorite the Fat Greek Combo, Zeus & Athena Beers and by recommendation from Jennica, the Greek Fries and  Flaming Feta, of course chicken tenders and spaghetti for the kids. The combo is huge, the fries indescribably delicious and just saying flaming feta makes my mouth water.  The kids...and adults loved the flaming presentation.\n\nJennica took very good care of us, the manager on duty even checked on our table and the owner Demetri stopped by too.  This staff obviously cares about the dining experience of their patrons!\n\nWe ate till our hearts and stomachs were content, who am I kidding, they were joyful!  And if that wasn't enough Jennica brought us out a dessert that was obviously created for a Greek God or at least a demigod or two. I'll do my best to describe in mortal words, vanilla ice cream sprinkled with cinnamon sat atop fried sweet bread with honey and whipped cream.  It was incredible.\n\nDefinitely sit on the patio and ask for Jennica, you won't be sorry.  Maybe a little stuffed, but not sorry at all!",201788
1,"It boggles my mind that MGM Grand can have such a rip off of a buffet and get away with it.  I guess having a giant casino and a lot of hungry clients walking out of Ka or just lots of gambling will do it.\n\nIt's not that the food is terrible; it's actually fairly decent, and there is a very large selection.  My concern here is why I'm spending $33 for corn dogs, fried chicken, and a do-it-yourself burrito section with dry beef and greasy beans.  You could get those items in a $10 lunch buffet these days.\n\nThat being said, it's not like they're completely devoid of decent food.  The day I went, there was a section where a chef will cut you a new york steak or a prime rib.  There was another section for king crab.  The issue here is that those items aren't anything special these days; The Mirage offers those as well for around $25.  Even worse is that the chefs were quite stingy with their meat, cutting me a small piece and telling me to come back later (presumably after stuffing myself with microwavable corn dog bites).\n\nIt seems to me that compared to more economical but quality buffets like the one at The Mirage, you're paying about $10 more for a larger selection at MGM Grand Buffet.  But the \""selection\"" we're talking about here is crap you could get from Hometown Buffet... hardly something I'd want to waste my time waiting in line for in Las Vegas.\n\nBottomline: If you're going to spend over thirty bucks for a buffet, go to the Bellagio or Wynn instead.  If you really must eat in MGM, go to one of their restaurants or even their food court with McDonald's.  Avoid the buffet.",204848

1,"Before I jump into my review I want to say that this place isn't necessarily \""Meh\"" for everyone. I've had many a massage for varying prices and quality, so based on that is why this place gets 2-stars.  I picked this place to go based on the reviews, but I guess I have a more picky palette when it comes to people touching me.\n\nCOST - Yes, this place is probably the cheapest and more decent for the price for a regular massage. But, I've had massages for about the same price in Hawaii that was better (And Hawaii is expensive as hell, like Las Vegas). I paid $89 for a 90 minutes massage.  It's a decent price I think, but just comparatively, I've had better for close to the same cost, if not cheaper.\n\nMASSAGE EXPERIENCE - Maybe I'm jaded or have been getting massages wrong for the past couple years, but usually when I get I massage they start with my back since usually there is the most tension there is probably requires the most attention, but what do I know? I'm not a massage therapist, but what I can say is that everything else was done first and my back last.  That's not something I'm use to and whether or not that is normal is for a pro to determine, but what I can say is that I feel like my back needed a lot more attention.  Also my neck needed a lot more attention, as I type this my neck hurts. That was one of the first things worked on, which I usually like ending with that.  I could mention many other things about my massage experience that had me unimpressed, but the order of things was a major one.\n\nAMBIANCE - The room itself was great. No complaints here.  Probably one of the better rooms I've had a massage in. As for the building, it was in the midst of renovations, which I can't complain about, but it just made the place look shady.\n\nPAYMENTS???? - Okay, so I made my appointment online, which I think is weird because if I don't know anything about massages, how am I to know what \""type\"" is best for my ailments?  Not only that, but they missed an opportunity to get me to spend more money, but because I did not understand their ordering system I just bought whatever massage I was familiar with.  I would've totally done more, but there was no customer service to sell me on more.  Not only was I peeved about that, but I had to pay for my appointment before I even got massaged.  That is ODD. Who does that? But I paid for it anyway.  I was peeved again that I could not add a tip to my payment, so I had to go withdraw cash before I came in and I did not know the neighborhood.\n\nOVERALL - Meh, seriously, but I'm basing this off the fact that I've been to many a massage therapist.  I'm a bit of a snob and usually when I find someone good I stay with that person, but I have yet to find someone in Las Vegas for me. :(",72485

1,I'm not saying this to be mean but what my inexperienced waitress did to me was comical and not excusable. I DO NOTE I am NOT basing my review on what she did and only the food but I feel it needs to be told so you see the whole picture.\n\nShe took our order and soon came to deliver the drinks . Her tray had three beverages a water an iced tea and a soda. Somehow she sorts of looses her balance and almost lost the water and it spills ON ME with Iced cubes hitting me but she manages to save it before it all splashes me. She said she was sorry but she suggested to ME TO CLEAN THE TABLE WITH THE PAPER TOWEL MYSELF! It's bad enough that she couldn't be bothered to clean that up but what really made it WORST was she left the wet napkin on the table the whole time we were dining. I do note she was very youthful and might have been only 15 or 16 years old so I have to chalk it up to that but I also note the cooks on the night I was here were also very youthful looking and I might not have experienced the food as it was meant to be prepared.\n\nWe started out with very average house salads and fried pickles appetizer. The salads seemed fresh and the dressing seemed bottled tasting and not so good. I thought the pickle appetizer was inedible not because of them being wet laden with oil but because of how overly salted they were. My husband who tolerates more salt than me didn't think inedible but he felt too that they were over salted and he ate only a few.\n\nOur two plates arrive and my husband got nearly everything they make on his plate and asked me to try stuff I didn't have. I only tried his short rib and had to stop there because it was DRY and almost cold. (YUK!) so then I moved on to my plate. I tried the BBQ'd Turkey first. It was almost good with good flavors and not too much sauce. I also liked that the sauce wasn't too sweet but like the Rib it was dry and almost cold. (YUK! again) So I figure maybe the chicken is good but I was WRONG again. (YUK!) Another almost COLD and VERY DRY. I really hate dry chicken. I had a nice looking side of vegetables but sadly they were ruined by a generous hand of BUDGET SEASONING SALT that tasted awful. Lastly I was hoping the corn bread would be ok but I WAS WRONG AGAIN and SADLY it was so dry and so from the box tasting even soaking it in honey butter couldn't fix it.\n\nI do note my husband said the store purchased hot link wasn't as dry as the BBQ'd other items. He also said the pork ribs were better than the beef rib. I also need to say  I hope that the day time crew prepares the food in the way the owner meant it to be. I say that because of the numerous BBQ awards they've earned that I saw here while dining. But.......\n\n\nOnly one word.......... \n\nPITIFUL,52564

It was perfect.\nVisit #3 - 1 car ahead of me.

This isn't Starbucks with 27 cars in line.  With just 1 or 2 cars this place grinds to a halt.  I don't know what the problem is.  My guess is that they offer 75 things on the menu.  Tons of coffee drinks, smoothies, sandwiches, etc.  They need to trim their offerings down 90% and only offer the basics to get people in and out ASAP.\n\nHopefully my Keurig will be fixed soon but this place comes in handy if there is nobody waiting or you have the patience of a saint.",549035

0,"There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""rewards\"" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them.",42781

Although they were very apologetic, I'm just not sure I can bring myself back to trying something else.  D'lish was a D'isappointment :(  Maybe I'll give the new Tempe location a try *sigh*.",240777

1,"I've been here well over 20 times since I moved to Las Vegas.  Not by choice...this is my uncle's favorite place to go whenever he's in town.  My mom also thinks this is a great place to take tourists in order to have the \""Vegas-Strip\"" experience.  Maybe I haven't gone on the right nights but I literally count the minutes down until everyone else is ready to go.  Or maybe I haven't had enough to drink to fully enjoy the whole mess!\n\nMy most recent visit was last weekend.  My husband's best friend had Navy friends in town for the weekend.  We were meeting them at Harrah's.  When they were done eating at Toby Keith's, we walked to the casino floor.  Someone suggested we walk into the Piano Bar...I told them they weren't going to like it and to save their money for another cover charge...the group decided to go in regardless.  By the time everyone got their drinks, they realized the mistake and were ready to go!  The sisters had started playing and were slaughtering song after song.  \n\nThis is the positive things I will say about this bar...the piano players have unbelievable memory recall on the songs.  I'm not impressed by their singing talent but they do have impressive piano skills.  The other thing I was impressed by was one of the bartenders here.  Normally if a drink order is wrong, for whatever reason, they just throw it out and start over.  I ordered an Amaretto on the rocks and didn't specify Disaronno.  He gave me the mistake drink for free and made me a new drink.  I thought that was a pretty sweet deal! \n\nI know I'll get trapped into going there again!  LOL!  Cheers to Uncle Larry!  :)",323481
2,this place is ok. 2 dollar coors and 1 8-10 oz  margaritas in the back of the place pretty cool...  cant beat that.... pre funk here or a good meeting place ... pretty central,280871
2,If you are looking for fast and cheap then this is your place. Full set of acrylics with pedi and brow wax for $90. The place is small old and loud. The TVs don't pick up the Satellite channels very well. \n\nThree star rating due it looking dirty with nail clippings from acrylics on the floor. And the place needs a coat of paint.,50647
0,"This store seems to be very hit and miss. I had ordered a 2 tiered wonder woman cake and it was perfect and I loved it. If it had been that experience alone I would have given them 5 stars but unfortunately it is not. I also ordered a lady gaga cake and this one missed the mark. The fondant it's lumpy and the piping it's extremely uneven. When I called to voice my disappointment the decorator Jay would not have it. He changed the cake was perfect and that if I wanted a specific look I should have agreed for it.  I will post pictures of the cake and what I feel the problem areas are. Sadly, I will find a new cake shop BC of his reaction and the quality.\n\n**UPDATE 8-6-14**\nSomeone from KAK has been harassing me on Yelp sending me messages as to question the validity of my statements. Claiming that I must have left the cake in the sun or that for some reason the quality of the cake is my own fault. Truth is I was unable to confront Jay face to face because I was uncomfortable with that but made sure to call him as soon as I left the store. The cake was kept cool under the AC in my brand new car and at no time had extreme exposure to the AZ heat. Jay had told me that the fondant was still soft because he had just finished the cake, mind you I ordered it nearly a month in advance. Never will I ever deal with this establishment and I will make sure that no one I know will go to this place.",371117

4,"Best authentic Mexican food in the East Valley. I'm set in my ways and get the carne asada burrito every time (been going here 6 years), and it has never disappointed. They don't pack your burro full of potatoes or beans, but instead you'll get tons of good beef with the perfect balance of onion and beans. Love the beans. Oh, and regardless the item on the menu, you'll leave VERY full for under $7 bucks.",521528
4,"Unlimited chips and salsa and buy one get one free Margaritas during Happy Hour: that's why we go.  The food isn't spectacular, but their signature dishes are innovative and good, although a little pricey.  There are certain menu items you can't get anywhere else.  \n\nTry the Panuchos (Pink Tacos) which is made with chicken.  \nYou have to order the Pink Taco Margarita on the rocks with salt.  The BEST!!  It's Jamaica based and you can't get it anywhere else.  \n\nUsually, we get too full on the drinks because it's buy one get one free and it has to be the same person, so expect to buy two drinks.  So we usually just get one plate and split.\n\nFor some odd reason, this Pink Taco is way better than the one in Hollywood.  And it's not because we're in Vegas and we're already having a good time, but the quality of the food and especially the drinks are better.  I know this because I've ordered the same drinks from this location and the one in Hollywood and Vegas wins!\n\nThe atmosphere here is fun and the patio is right by the pool.   This place is for lounging: eat, drink, converse and be merry without a sense of time.",172813

0,"Just returned from SoCal Fish Taco Co.  Very disappointing.  Decor and design was interesting, server good, but that's where it all ended.  Don't think much was made from scratch.  Everything tasted canned, salsa, weak cocktail sauce (more like regular ketchup) beans, tortillas......EVERYTHING.  \n\nReally wanted to like this place.  No flavor/seasonings ... Boring.  Wish it was different.  Shrimp tacos and grouper tacos had no flavor at all.  Shrimp had watery/boiled texture.  Not worth it.  Missed opportunity for this company.",605626
1,"Maybe it's the secluded location or perhaps the strange after taste of the broth left on your tongue.\n\nWhatever the case be, I really am not a fan of the place. The restaurant is pretty spacious with a karaoke stage to your left upon entering. There's a big \""fruit tree\"" located in the middle which is a nice sight. However, the wait time for food is rather long. I went here with a group of 7 and had to wait about 40 minutes for food? Nothing comparable to Pho Kim Long (my go to place for pho).  \n\nI'm pretty easily fulfilled with pho from any place, but I was just thrown off by the after taste of the broth as stated above. My final verdict? If you can get pho somewhere else - go for it.",285485
4,"This is a perfectly awesome sports bar.\n\nYou can go there for any big game for any sport, and they will have it on one of their many screens WITH SOUND!!  They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.\n\nI recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \""5-star\"" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.  Good food, done right.",9641
4,I've been back twice since I wrote this review.  Same great food; same great music.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.,144976
1,"For the price, this place is seriously below par. \n\nI had a 40-minute sugar scrub/massage, for around $140. The treatment itself was fine, and the therapist was personable and efficient. The room was relaxing and pleasant, though the music was more elevator-style adult contemporary than traditional Zenlike spa music. Kinda lame.\n\nThe spa facilities are what really suck, though. If you want a massage, fine -- pay the $180 and get your treatment; then get the hell out. I can do a better spa day at my cheap-ass gym!!!\n\nThere is no reason to loiter here. The \""relaxation room\"" is bland, stocked with tea, apples and vapid Vegas magazines. The rest of the facility consists of a tiny locker room, teeny bathroom, and a steam room. That's it. If you want to soak in a whirlpool, you have to go OUT IN THE CASINO, down the hall, down the elevator, down another hall, and outdoors to the pool area. All this in your spa robe and slippers! And I visited in January -- WAY too cold to be walking outdoors in a wet robe!!\n\nI came with three girlfriends, and the place wasn't big enough for all of us. There are only two showers, and one was broken...so we had to take turns. The vanity area in the locker room was tiny, and one of the blow dryers was broken, so most of us just went up to our rooms to get ready. Keep this in mind if you're planning a spa day for your bridal party or something like that -- this place is only big enough to accommodate 2 guests at a time. Besides which, it sucks.\n\nIf I'm paying $140 for a massage, I want a fancy experience, dammit! Otherwise I'd just go to Massage Envy.",535914
1,"Not a huge fan of this place but I have been here for lunch several times with co-workers. It works well for a large group since they can easily accommodate seating large parties due to the size of the restaurant and they have a very varied menu so everyone can find something that sounds good. The quality of the food is nothing impressive but I can't really say I have ever eaten anything there that was bad. Just average. We have always gotten good service, though, but if its my choice I would not eat here. \n\nThis place has always reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory. Very similar food and decor but I do think its a little better. I didn't know that they were owned by the same company until I read the reviews on Yelp but it totally makes sense.",291969
1,"I would not waste my time on this one again. Food was bleh, portions okay. Decor and memorabilia were just okay.",134732
1,Folks this is very overrated.. they had Guy's Diners Drivein and Dives there only because Guy's parents knew owner. This is very avg food at best. Its nothing special.I wont go back..

1,"I would have to say that my husband and I didn't enjoy our experience here, we ordered two po boy sandwiches and two fountain drinks and the total bill was almost $30.00, for that price we could've had a sit down dinner and not fast food creole. As we ate, the server's children ran rampant through the restaurant, and there was discussion about whether she or her mother were going to be working or taking care of the children the following day. Then my husband walked up to the counter to get me a to go container and while he was talking to her, she answers her cell phone and practically ignores him. Terrible service and atmosphere, the po boys were actually good but not worth $10-13 a piece. We thought they had made a mistake on our bill when we saw it was $27.00, that's pricey for fast food sandwiches!",364027
1,The bartenders were to busy playing with there friends. I didn't feel welcomed.,528464
4,"I have not been to France, and frankly don't care much about authenticity.  But I do care about good food.

Everything was great.  \n\nEvery.  Damn.  Thing.\n\nI can't order quiche anywhere else now because it's so leaden and flavorless compared to La Baguette's\n\nI live on the east side, I only drive across the Isthmus when I can't avoid it.  but since I discovered this place I have been doing a lot more shopping near West Town.  I consider myself lucky it is not located on Willy street, or I would be many pounds heavier by now.\n\nOnly quibble I have is not being able to go on Sundays when I have more time to drive around for brunch.

2,"As far as Target's go this one is pretty darn good. I mean, they sell the same everything and anything that every other Target does and the sales are just as good, but where they really shine is on Clearance items. For some reason they always seem to put the most fantastic stuff on clearance. Charcoal satin drapes. Plaid cloth flats. Three packs of Old Spice deoderant. Occasionally Choxie. Be sure to check out the Clearance sections in every department (or, you know, don't so I can snatch up all the finds).\n\nI am, however, pretty sure that the parking deck of this Target is the national headquarters for driving like an asshole.  It's like someone purposely filled the place with inept and rude drivers. The main level is usually packed anyway so i tend to park down a level and just take the stairs. Infinitely less infuriating.",293206
1,"Oh, Westgate Center...\n I live just down the street from this shiny mecca of overpriced, mediocre chains. While I have never attended a sporting event or concert here I do frequent a few of the establishments within this development periodically. If you must eat here I recommend Kabuki (Japanese) or the Yard House (American, upscale pub food with an impressive beer and liquor menu). My boyfriend and I attended the 2011 New Year's Eve event here with a few friends for two reasons: 1)we had just moved here and 2) were too exhausted to do much of anything else. That was a huge mistake! I felt slightly misled as to what we were gaining access to upon paying for admission. Our admission allowed us to only stand in the middle of the common area and listen to a band and pay for a fairly expensive, limited variety of cocktails. All of the bars and restaurants had their own separate cover. Call me crazy, but that seems like a ridiculous business plan. It would have made more sense if they had raised the cover and allowed all of those people to flow freely through the restaurants and bars that Westgate offers. Don't be so stingy Westgate!",270818
3,"Note: I only give out 5 stars to restaurants that are EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.\n\nOh, how I truly wish I could give Stick E Rice 5 stars! If I could grant this place 4.5 stars, I would quickly and happily do so. I spent the last few minutes debating this review with my wife, who is absolutely convinced that Stick E Rice deserves 5 stars.\n\nThis restaurant has several strong points. Their service is truly amazing. Every time I have come here, I have had the pleasure of being served by the same waitress, whose friendly greetings and smiles make me feel like a member of her family. The waitstaff is always on point, from timing courses well to clearing used dishes promptly. Drink refills are typically not an issue, unless you're only drinking water (but they never leave you wanting for a refill). The reason for this is that soft drinks are served ice cold in cans, accompanied by cold glasses filled with ice. I know that restaurants typically may profit more from serving soft drinks in cans, but I feel that better establishments provide fountain drinks with free refills.\n\nI ordered the potstickers as an appetizer, and they are VERY tasty and lack the excessive \""doughiness\"" served by so many other restaurants. I don't know if they're homemade, but I can tell you that surely you can't go wrong in placing an order for them.\n\nI typically order from the lunch special menu, so my meal is accompanied by a complimentary soup. The egg drop soup is tasty, and served in an attractive cup with a side of crispy chow mein \""chips.\"" I once had a rendition of the hot and sour soup, and I honestly have to say that it needs much work to resemble a true Chinese hot and sour soup.\n\nThe main courses are always flavorful. The portions may seem small, but upon finishing my order I am always very satisfied. The pepper steak, orange chicken, pad thai and mixed vegetable options are wonderful entrees. My wife's regular favorite entree is the \""mixed vegetables with added shrimp.\""\n\nYou simply must leave room for dessert!  Stick E Rice offers a dessert called \""Stick E Mango\"" that is absolutely a must-have! We order it every time we come here. Every time. The sticky rice is formed in sushi-sized pieces, and bear the almost banana-like sweetened flavor of coconut. Each order is seemingly bombarded with sliced mango! The mango has always been sweet and succulent; I have never had the unpleasantness of biting into a more green or hardened slice of mango. The mango is drizzled with a sweetened coconut \""caramel.\""\n\nI absolutely cannot fathom why anyone could possibly review Stick E Rice with less than a 3-star rating! Sure, the menu may not be perfectly Thai; this restaurant has more of a Thai-Chinese fusion offering, but this combination serves to offer its clientele more choices and even a more familiar option for the less brave. The menu is also somewhat customizable to personal taste and spiciness preference.\n\nTo maybe receive a 5-star rating:\n1. Serve fountain drinks with free refills. Even if free refills are not offered, at least, do not serve the soft drinks in cans! That's what I would expect at a home BBQ, not at a nicer restaurant. At a minimum, to preserve the appearance of \""freshness,\"" the soft drinks could be served in unopened, chilled glass bottles. I still prefer and strongly recommend the fountain drink option for cost effectiveness and \""friendliness\"" when serving very spicy food that may need to be frequently washed down.\n2. The restroom is very clean and spacious, but one must pass the register area and the doorway to the kitchen in order to access the restroom. I understand that this is a small business, but the area near the register should be kept clutter-free. I saw stacks of various papers, mail and other things which gave the appearance of an \""amateur\"" business. Clean that area up, especially if it's visible to clients. The kitchen is quite clean from what I could see. Then again, I shouldn't be able to see into the kitchen. Due to design limitations, a door is an unsafe option, but perhaps a sheer curtain or something may be put up to obscure the customer's view into the cooking area, and to somewhat muffle the noise coming from the kitchen into the dining area. I don't know what options are available, but that's not my job, is it?\n3. Move the music system to the back counter, out of sight.  At a minimum, hide the speaker wires or install some recessed or wireless speakers.\n4. Refine the menu more (i.e. hot and sour soup).",465375
0,"I was in town for a national healthcare related conference hosted at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I had never been to Las Vegas before this, nor have I ever gambled. I flew in a day early and stayed at a Marriott in Henderson. I spent the next day hiking to the Hoover Dam and some nearby mountains.\n\nI had a rental car. For a first-timer, the Strip is a little daunting. After some maneuvering, I found Caesar's Palace. I didn't know they had free valet service and wouldn't you know it, the free parking garage is a loooong walk from the check-in desk. \n\nWhen I checked in I made a grave mistake that only someone who has never been to Vegas makes. I didn't tip the registration person before I checked in. This guaranteed me the worst room available at that time. I hadn't done enough homework on the nuances of Vegas. I would be paying for my initial error many times over again during my stay.\n\nI asked if there was a cart I could use to haul my week's worth of clothing and tradeshow materials to my room. I was curtly told that wasn't possible, but I could employ a staff member to do it for me. I declined. Even though it was going to be an ordeal to carry all of it through the floor of the casino, I could physically handle it. I was in the Roman Towers. It took three trips.\n\nAfter I checked in the room, I took a shower. The room itself was a nice size. I had a view of an interior courtyard rooftop. There was no door on the bathroom. There was a handset phone next to the toilet, more antiquated than quaint.\n\nA small TV screen was next to one of the sinks. The bath tub was large and in-charge. \n\nI went downstairs and signed up to get a player's club. I also signed in on FourSquare and was given a free buffet at Lagos as a special. \n\nI told them I had never gambled before and they took their time answering my questions. You can't buy chips with a credit card, but there are ATM machines all around that take plastic. You don't even need to know your pin number (you just pay a higher fee).\nI had set my limit at $100. When I withdrew it, I got a hundred dollar bill (instead of 20s). Next to the ATM is a machine which will turn your $100 bills into smaller denominations. \n\nI found a helpful young lady at the small concession stand near the parking lot elevator who gave me a map of the facility.\n\nI had dinner at the Noodle restaurant by the lobby elevator. The d\u00e9cor is a shocking white pattern with mirrors reflecting light into your eyeballs which still maybe adjusting from the dimness of the casino floor. They had massive fish tanks filled with thousands of goldfish.\n\nThe beer that says draft on the menu is not what we in America consider a draft. It was a weak beer in a bottle and draft was the brand. The noodle dish was okay, but average isn't what I want from Vegas dining, not at the price for my dinner.\n\nAll night I was roused through vigorous banging on the hotel wall at random times. Several thumps were hard enough to shake my bed. In the morning there was no cold water in the shower. Thankfully the bathtub had a hand-held shower extension and I could bathe there. That was the only morning that the shower's cold water didn't work.\n\nI discovered my room shared a wall with the servant's elevator and work room. That is what had made the noises the night before (and every night at random times during my entire stay).\n\nI ate each morning at Lagos and each time, it was excellent (except the last day). They have two lines. If you are a diamond or seven club member, there is no waiting. Otherwise, come at the wrong time, and the line looks like a crowd waiting for a Disney ride. I arrived early enough (8AM) each day that there was no line. Typically by the time I left, folks were accumulating, much more so on the weekend.\n\nThey had wonderful lox, capers and other delights. The waitstaff, almost to a fault, was exceedingly attentive. The only negative experience was when I asked to see if my friend had arrived before I did for our meal. I was told to look from the door but was discouraged from entering to see if he was indeed there.\n\nOn our last morning, the buffet had turned from being breakfast into being a 'brunch'. What that meant for us much greater cost and almost none of the good food we'd been enjoying all week. Lox were gone, and most of the regular breakfast items were either low or out. \n\nAnother friend of mine who arrived separately was incredulous that we didn't know the tip rule. He had the same level of room reserved as we did (same conference) and tipped the front desk $50 on check-in. He was given a palatial, presidential suite. \n\nYou can smoke in Vegas casinos. I don't mind second hand smoke, so it didn't bother me.\n\nThe TV doesn't get many channels other than Caesar/Las Vegas promos/Asian ones. The internet is woeful and expensive, but I didn't expect anything else. I brought my Sprint hotspot and was getting 4G almost everywhere.\n\nThe pool is nice, but randomly, private parties bar all but diamond/7 stars.",236454

There is always chicken tandoori, and Kheer, which is all that I need to make me happy. Sometimes they have Saag, and it's so delicious. The music is nice and the ambiance is very pleasant.

3,"Pretty Cool Company.\n\n1.  Care - If you call at the right time, Mike will answer the phone as well, and to speak to the owner that has so many years of experience is great.\n\n2.

People are happy and it is working perfectly. Other companies we used to help us before were not professionally up to speed on the CRAFT of the business.\n\n4.  Personally - I was so happy that I decided to use them for my personal home as well and have it fully checked out. I like the team and service so I will be using them again.\n\n5.

That is the key.  \n\n6.  Urgent again - Called them to the house again as I was having a party in four hours during the heat of the Summer at 109 degrees outside. I was cooking and using the ovens inside!  4 hours before the party, I was setting the temp down low to cool the house as we were going to have a ton of people. The temperature was not working and one air con unit was not coming on..... The house and I were getting HOT.  Why now and why on a weekend again!!!! They came in 1  hour, determined it was a faulty thermostat that I installed 10 years ago and replaced it with one of theirs. All was good. I was expecting the \""you need to replace your system\"" quote.  They also checked out other items before they left.\n\n7.  Price - You often get what you deserve.  I think that they are expensive as the product that install can be purchased on line or at stores for cheaper and all, however, when you have an emergency, they are there, they are ready, they have the parts and you pay the \""right\"" amount, not the lowest amount.

2,"Curry in the Box is consistently decent. It's not spectacular, but it's predictable and tastes quite good. The renovations are nice, and the atmosphere has improved considerably. \n\nIn the past, I have gotten Panang Chicken, Roti, Volcano Chicken, Crab Rangoon, and Spring Rolls. All of them are tasty and flavored well, and remarkably reasonably priced. \n\nThe service is excellent; the people are friendly and the food is ready very quickly. It's a great place to go for a quick, cheap dinner.\n\nIn my opinion, Sa Bai Thong is the best Thai food in Madison, but Curry in the Box is a close second.",318801

Hate to say that I was sadly disappointed with \""Skribble Saturdays.\"" The music was not on point and crowd was kind of dead. The only thing that would make this club worth visiting is the view on the terrace. If you get there when they first open the outdoor area you might find somewhere to sit.

4,"I've been to may steak houses in many cities, usually ordering a NY Sirloin. But I've never had a steak as good as I did at Botero this past week. I ordered it rare/med rare and it was done perfectly. Warm red inside with a seared exterior, perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper. The size was very generous and it was well trimmed. I just had a side of mushrooms that was enough for 2 or 3. If there was one complaint, wine by the glass was limited with just one Cabernet at $25. Other red wines were under $20.",366207
3,"Stopped in today after church, clean, upbeat environment.   First time here, so we asked about their most popular sandwiches.  Definitely gave a great recommendation - I went with the #9 Italian Night Club w/ hot peppers.  Good amount of meat, and other condiments.  Peppers gave it a nice little kick, even picked up a bag of their Jalapeno Potato Chips.  My only complaint is I wish the sandwich was a little bigger, it was gone, but I wanted to keep eating because it was so good.   \n\nFed a family of 4 for about $20, which isn't too bad.

So I grab another straw and yep it's good but kind of hard to mess up pineapple juice. \n\nNow to the food, no untensils no condiments, had to ask for everything! \nSo I ordered a short stack of pancakes (2) with a side of ham. Pancakes were just ok, I can do bisquick better. Ham steak was cooked on the same grill as the regular steak so had a charbroiled steak taste.

The food takes equally long to get to your table, I've actually gotten a COLD sandwich because the turn around time was so long.\nThe view in the summer is nice, sitting on the roof people watching after being couped up in an office all day is a excellent way to unwind.

3,"Due to the fact that I didn't feel like spending a ton of money and going to a packed restaurant on Valentines Day, my husband planned a romantic night in and decided to order from Giada's for the first time. (Thankfully, since I wouldn't have made it to see feb 15th if he cooked for us,lol).\n\nTo start, it may seem like a long wait but I was really impressed we only had to wait an hour and twenty minutes to get out food delivered. We're a good 4.5 miles away and I'm sure they were really busy, so points to them for that, and points for a really friendly delivery man! \n\nFood wise, it did arrive cold which wasn't great because one of the dishes was chicken Parm and the cheese was no longer bubbly and soft. As much as I have to take a point off for this, I really don't hold it against them. Since it was valentines day, I do imagine it must have sat  there ready for a bit before someone was actually able to get it out to us. I'm ok with it for that reason. We popped it in the oven and for the most part brought it back to life. \n\nOnce it was ready despite the fact that my chicken Parm wasn't up to it's potential, the food was pretty tasty, especially their sauce which had a mild kick and a nice bold flavor. In Italian cooking, the sauce can really make or break the dish, and their's definitely elevated these dishes. I honestly wish their was more,  but that's my only complaint there.\n\nOverall, I feel that Giada's has potential to be 5 stars in my book, but I'll have to reserve that until next time I order. If the food comes hot and bubbly next time, I'll gladly update the review, but for now, it's worth it to try. Their prices, in my opinion, are reasonable, and you get a lot for your money.",509217
2,"This was my third year attending Bite of Las Vegas. Is it just me or is Switchfoot the main headliner EVERY year? I was very excited to hear that Sara Bareillis was performing as she is one of my favorite artists. \n\nI agree with Heather, even though there were the same amount of booths as last year, there were noticeably less FOOD booths. I even noticed some booth's charging $6 for certain items, I thought all portions were to be between $1-$5. \n\nThe parking situation was HORRIBLE, I knew not to park in the Flamingo/Twain but I was still stuck in the rocky gravel. It would be fine if they had some kind of control of the aisles. Their were huge gaps between rows and cars that could have made parking a lot easier for many. My friend mistakenly went to the Flamingo lot and was told the only way out was to jump the curb, in a Honda Accord! That is unacceptable at an event where there is an entrance fee. They should have enough money from ticket sales to afford proper parking attendants. Less American Idol rejects, more parking attendants!\n\nThe food was really good and I definitely overindulged, I do like the layout of the event. You basically make a loop and try out whatever you want.",408328
2,"If you're headed there for  the lunch hour, you probably should put your \""out of office\"" on your email because you'll be there for at least the next two hours. \n\nAlas, when I saw that there was a lunch special (about $10 for a half salad and pizza), I figured it would be a relatively typical lunch hour. Usually places that have lunch specials abide by the 1-hour lunch rule, but definitely not this place--at least, not in this instance. Holy moly, I had no idea that it took so long to make salad and pizza at Humble Pie. I am a regular at Sauce Pizza + Wine, and it usually takes them about 3 minutes to bring my salad after ordering, then another 5 minutes to have my pizza out. I think we were about 45 minutes into being at Humble Pie when our salads were brought out. I think my coworker was about ready to eat his shirt at that point.\n\nAlright, so how good was this hyped up place? Well...it was ok. First, I was a little surprised that the restaurant was small and the tables were kind of cramped, but I guess that adds to the ambiance of being a humble place. I ordered the strawberry & gorgonzola salad, which was OK, but not very flavorful. It kind of tasted like a salad I'd make at home. My pizza was a standard pepperoni, to which I added on olives. The pepperoni is the smaller diameter style pepperoni found at some other specialty pizza joints like Grimaldi's. It was uber salty and greasy, which felt very sinful as I was eating it. I think there was enough pepperoni on the pizza to cover 2 or 3 pizzas, actually. The crust, cheese and sauce were good, however. I suppose I should have ordered a veggie pizza or something a little less meaty to enjoy my meal.\n\nOverall, the food was OK, but nothing out of the ordinary special that I'd die to take my friends to. At least the service is pretty good (aside from the kitchen being super low), so I suppose I'd be OK with going back and giving it another shot...on a weekend.",364875

1,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for a Saturday night date. We were seated quickly by what appeared to be an owner. We'll call him \""The Boss\"" (tall man with a baseball cap on). The Boss sat us, bussed our table, wiped it down, and then gave us menus. Said our server would be with us \""shortly\"". \""Shortly\"" was the understatement of the year at this place. The Boss came back about 15 minutes later to ask us if we'd ordered drinks yet. We hadn't.  He ordered and brought us our drinks. 35 MINUTES LATER our waitress Morgan appeared. We'd been watching her serve the couple at the same table we were seated at and several tables near us for the past half hour. We ordered food. Entire order was wrong and Morgan didn't offer to take it back to have it fixed. We were also charged for food portions we didn't order as well as paid for the incorrectly prepared entree. We also watched the Boss seat a new couple next to us and get their drinks as well. The waitress finally asked if they needed new drinks/food an hour and ten minutes later after they had been sat. An hour. And ten minutes. Really? Really. The food here was amazing though. That's the only reason they got two stars. The boss was excellent as well.

1,"I'm a vegetarian and normally prefer hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants, but I was in Montreal, so wanted to eat French. But I know French food is not generally vegetarian friendly, so searched for one that was and chose this one for that reason and because folks seem to love it. But I didn't. \n\nI started with a tomato salad, the only non-meat appetizer of any sort. It was pretty good, especially the herbs sprinkled throughout, but they served it on a small cutting board for some reason, which was just plain stupid. I had to try extra hard not to have it fall into my lap or get balsamic vinegar everywhere.\n\nThere were three vegetarian entrees -- a pasta, a vegetable plate, and a tomato tart. The tart sounded most interesting and French, so I ordered that. It took forever to come and when it did it looked like some poorly executed \""artisinal\"" pizza you'd get at a mall Italian restaurant trying to go uptown. It tasted better than that, but not by much. It wasn't a tart as I'd define one. It was a piece of poorly done crust, with some tomatoes and cheese, and a few greens, thrown on top, and probably put in the broiler for a minute.\n\nShortly before my tart came, the restaurant sat another couple right beside me with only about a foot separating our tables even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It made the rest of the night uncomfortable for me as a solo diner. I doubt the couple liked it either. When I finished my meal, I asked for my check, waited forever, read about 20 pages of a book without anyone paying any attention to me, and then had to flag someone down to ask again.\n\nThe music -- early Stones and T-Rex -- was the best part of the restaurant, which is pretty sad.",371131
1,"Claustrophobia galore! My boyfriend and I had reservations for his birthday and we were scared of hitting someone with the door! Raku is a small restaurant with tables so close to one another that it's not only  difficult to move around but it is challenging to have an intimate dinner with those you love. The portions and price ratio are somewhat outrageous! (Small, dinky portions and it costs a lot!) Can't say I was too pleased with my time here.\n\nIn my personal opinion, this place is overrated. My friend had glorified this place like no other and even the yelp ratings confirmed his love for this place. Unfortunately, I can't say the same :(. I expected this place to be so very close to how the yakitori places are in Japan. This place definitely falls short. \n\nDespite my disappointment, I must say, I was impressed by the quality and the menu. However, for the price and atmosphere, I don't see this as a worthy place to dine in. We ended up getting a few skewers of meat; I know we got the wagyu beef which definitely stood out, the tofu (the best thing I had on this menu) and grilled tako. No bueno on that grilled tako; I felt as if I was chewing on a rubber chicken that was burnt flavored. Blah! I honestly don't know why this place is highly rated; it's between \""good\"" and \""ok\"" but it isn't \""OMG this place is the s**t!\""\n\nI really tried to love this place. I tried to accept and tried to convince myself that I'm paying for high quality food, but seriously, this place is almost an insult. I had to stop at $85 worth of food because I wasn't sure how much I would need to spend to feel full and satisfied. I'm sad I wasted my hard earned money here and couldn't give my boyfriend an awesome birthday dinner. Vegas needs to step up their game on authentic yakitori places.\n\nPS. if you decide you want to go to Raku, I suggest not walking in as you are unlikely to get a table as a walk in.

Wife got her birthday \""grand slam\"".  OMG...I don't know what they did but it was disgusting.  The pancakes tasted heavy and fat and, well, just \""yucky\"".  They should have been \""light and fluffy\"", as most breakfast places will make them.  Eggs weren't a lot better.  I wouldn't be surprised if eating that shaved a year or two off her life.  It was free for her birthday, and I still think we got ripped off on that one!\n\nI had a burger and fries.  Well...they were better than McDonald's.  Can't say they were bad.  But definitely nothing special.  You could make a better one in your own kitchen in about 10 minutes for a fraction of the cost.  If you want a decent burger try Fuddruckers or Red Robin or someplace like that.  For the price, Denny's burger was definitely not worth it.\n\nI don't care if it's free on your birthday, it's not worth it.  Don't come here.",429120

Tonight we ordered 2 buffalo chicken sangwiches. Simple! We get home and we have breaded chicken sangwiches with mayo.....okay. the rest of the order is fine so I call back and re ordered. My fiance and I didn't get to sit down to eat till 10;30pm! And what do we find? Another chicken w/mayo with wing sauce on the side....one with wing sauce and nothing else. \n\nThese guys were not busy when I went in to the To Go entrance and seeing as they ruined this simple order twice within an hour, means they've got some pretty bad cooks, or some pretty bad attitudes. \n\nOh and the fries were cold both times.

The eggs were done perfectly, the Canadian bacon wasn't overcooked and was a thick slice, and they put just enough sauce. The hashbrowns weren't bad, but were a little mushy.\nService is the reason for not getting 4 stars. Phuong was my server and kept calling me lady, I hate that. It took her a while to get to the table, she was hiding out in  the back since they weren't busy when I got here. In total I think she came to the table like 3 times.",307452

So I was there with a friend enjoying their fantastic potato salad and she had scarfed hers down in like 5 seconds and her fork was headed towards mine. I stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled NO! And just think, this is JUST the potato salad from here! \n\nThe burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever! I stick with the cheeseburger because I want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it. I literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side. Ok, I know that sounds dirty...but it was SO good!! I haven't strayed much from the burgers, but I did have the tuna melt once and it was good, but nothing compares to the burgers. I mean, that's what you go there for! Plus, my friend saw Russell Crowe there while he was filming a movie in the burgh, so you have to know it's good if his peeps recommended he go there!",3507

Which I'm sure they think is very edgy, but I just enjoy watching idiot tourists walk around searching in desperation for a sign to show them the way. Think you're in the wrong city for that.\n\nThe wait was a little long, but it was reasonable considering the high volume of shmoozies that were there. My friends and I stick to our traditional and delicious plain cheese pizza, and it was large and awesome. Not too greasy, a very generous size for a large, and the price is right.",495894

0,"We were give a gift certificate for this restaurant, and thought we would go for Valentines day. I made reservations a week before at the Sahara location, and called the day before to confirm. When we arrived, there were 4 other couples in the doorway waiting. We stood there for 10 minutes before someone came to the front. BTW, there is no podium or reception area at the front either) Did they greet us? NO. They took one couple to be seated. At that point, another young couple that was waiting, said to us, \""That's the 2nd couple that's been seated since we arrived half hour ago, and we were here before they were. We're appaled and would rather go elsewhere. Good luck to you.\"" We began to wonder if we should stay. We figured we would wait a while longer. After all, it was Valentines Day, where else are we going to get seated at the last minute?\nAbout 15 minutes went by, and no one came to greet us, and there were 2 empty tables. I walked across the room near the kitchen entrance and told one of the employees we had been waiting over 20 minutes, and no one has even aknowledged our presence, and that we had a reservation. Their response was, \"" sorry, it's Valentines Day and we're short staffed.\"" I informed them that was not my problem, and at the very least someone could at least greet us & inform us that they're running behind. Again, the response was, \""Sorry, we're too busy.\"" At that point we left as the other couple behind us did the same.\n\nA week later, we decided to return for my birthday(after all, we had a free gift certificate to use). If I had trusted my instincts the first time, I would've left the certificate on Valentines Day for someone else to use.\nAfter we again waited 10 minutes before someone aknowledged we were even there, we were seated., We were brought a wine list and asked for our drink order. We stated we would have water while we looked over the wine list. The server brought out tapwater with no ice, and a basket of very dry bread. Again, I started to question myself. (Should I go somewhere else?)\nThe salad was served on a warm plate with very runny dressing. My wife asked for her dressing on the side, and of course her salad was drenched instead.\nFor the main meal, my wife had an undercooked piece of fish, and I had overcooked gnocci.\nThis was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I made sure they were aware of that when I informed them they were not getting a tip. I would stay away from this place. The staff is rude, and they clearly do not care about the customer whatsoever. I'm glad I had a gift certificate, because I most certainly would not have paid for this experience.",316781
4,"I'm visiting from LA, where we may have a good sushi place or two.  But I found this restaurant on Yelp, and off I went, thinking I'd look more toward meat items, as I'd eaten at another sushi restaurant the night before.  When I pulled up to the restaurant, admittedly I was a bit worried, because the signage made me think cookie cutter strip mall Japanese restaurant.  (Usually, when I think Japanese restaurant in a strip mall, I feel more comfortable if it looks like a dive.)  But generic outside appearance aside, this restaurant holds its own with some of the top restaurants of its kind in LA, and brought to mind restaurants like Wa and the original Katsu-ya.  I began with a house specialty, yellowtail sashimi with just enough tempura jalapeno in a garlic and yuzu-based sauce, before moving on to beef tataki, seared to a beautiful texture with a garlic chili oil.  Both were delicious and perfectly tender.  From there, the chef came out--it was wonderful to get such personal attention (and the restaurant was quite busy)--and we discussed what I might want next.  He suggested I try a white sea bass he had just gotten in, and then a trio of taro tostadas, each a combination of a different fish, spice (as in heat) and avocado cream.  They were fabulous small bites.  I finished my meal with the signature miso marinated black cod, perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful, accompanied with a yuzu-based vinaigrette that complemented it perfectly.\n\nMy primary server was quite attentive and personable (as were all the others), the setting is unpretentious and comfortable, and I didn't know until the end that Chef had graciously given me the white sea bass and tostada tastings.  That was just the cherry on top of an exceptional meal.  It won't be the cheapest Japanese meal you've ever had (though the prices are very fair for what you get, and there are good deals to be had at happy hour and lunch), and if you're a quantity over quality person, there are probably better choices, but if you appreciate top quality, extremely fresh ingredients handled deftly by a talented chef, this is your restaurant.  Even if it were in LA, Soho would still be a standout.  Next time I'm in Vegas, this will be at the top of my list.",620164
3,"Occasionally I just feel like going out for just basic breakfast, i come to this particular MacDonald's.  It's a place to have a big breakfast and watch some of the interesting people that you now are regulars among others. It's always clean and the service pretty quick. it's by no means and exciting venue!   is okay for what it is.  I am not a big breakfast eater so it serves the purpose when I am in that particular mood.\n\nWhen I am traveling I often go to a MacDonald's for breakfast.  I usually need to eat something and can count on pretty standard fare and a decent price.  If it's just before catching a plane in the morning, a Greek meal that I might prefer first thing in the morning might not set well at takeoff as a big breakfast..",19774

3,"Okay, I live up the street. I remember when this was a small, open air mall. Times have changed. It's huge. It has everything from sports memorabilia to Italian fashion. It's a place where I like to people-watch. I'm not a big customer here because the place just has a bit too much of the \""Snottsdale\"" feeling to it. By that I mean people trying to impress each other and themselves. They never buy much, but they walk around with their noses in the air. That's okay. It's the culture of Scottsdale and I accept that. It is fun to sit down and observe and listen in on the one-upmanship that goes on. \n\nI patronize many of the companies that are represented at SFS, just not there. I waled into one store for an item I knew they carried. The sales girl had no clue. I pointed to it and she picked up the wrong one. They have an AT&T store which is virtually bare of products. Why? But this isn't a criticism of the mall, but of Scottsdale and this mall gives Scottsdale what it wants: Image and little substance. \n\nBut that's the community this mall serves and it's a good fit. I don't need to pay to see the circus when I can come here for free. It's just plain amusing.",159146

I ordered the spicy pork dish which is accompanied by a small bowl of rice and the requisite Korean side dishes.  The pork was tasty, and a bit spicy, but on the fatty side.  The sides were mostly un-remarkable.  All in all, it was fun to try something new, but there was nothing here that I experienced that would bring me back.\n\nI did read the other reviews that talked about the soups, so I might have to give it another shot ... so many places to try, so little time/money.",252461
1,"Food was excellent. Truffle mac & cheese = amazeballs. Dining in first class restaurants on a frequent basis, I was less than impressed with the attitude I was given when I arrived for our reservation. I was informed that due to the fact that we were a bit late for our reservation that they set a time limit as to when we needed to leave. This is absurd, especially for a group of us that spent over $1,000 on food alone...not including the alcohol. The vibe of the restaurant is trendy, and if I weren't trying to speak with my friends on the opposite side of the table, I wouldn't have been bothered by the extreme noise level. I typically do not complain about service at a restaurant, especially in Vegas, but I felt compelled to share my experience in hopes that they improve their blahzay client service. All in all, I was impressed by the food and overall vibe, however the hostesses need to check their attitude.",222939

We started with a fish sharing board, which included mackerel, salmon, and I believe trout, along with eggplant slices and other vegetables. Very good starter. My date has this thing about haggis - he has toured all around the UK and tries it wherever it's offered. The verdict was a decent haggis, which I tasted (off the bucket list). I had the chicken wrapped in Parma ham - \""dry\"" was my overall impression. Salads were good.\n\nThe alcohol solution was pretty positive. Innis and Gunn in the bottle, a nice brew indeed. Also very nice scotch. Glenkinchie was the special - loved it.\n\nThe service was polite but a little disorganized.\n\nI was surprised that two reviews were one star.

The pizza? Well, it was passable. Definitely not the best pizza, but far from the worst. \n\nWould I go there again? Perhaps.

1,"Eh...  \n\nMaybe this place is just too sophisticated for my palate.\n\nHubby and I came here for lunch last Monday.  I ordered the Shabu style Hot and Sour soup with tofu, and hubby ordered the sugar cane pork spare ribs and chili lime beef.\n\nThe soup was alright, but not very substantial.  It came with a variety of vegetables, some japanese vegetable I cannot even begin to spell, mushrooms, baby corn, and tomatoes.  I must admit, the hot house tomatoes sort of threw me off.  Because it said Shabu style, i had envisioned something more, more noodles and tofu for dipping perhaps?  Anyway, I definitely would not order that dish again.\n\nThe chili lime beef was actually a beef carpaccio, more lime than chili.  Not that I have anything against carpaccio, but there was nothing on the menu to indicate it would be carpaccio style, and I feel like that is something you should disclose.  \n\nThe sugar cane pork definitely stole the show.

It can easily be shared by two folks.\n\n-I found that the meat dishes (duck, beef, and pork) outshined the seafood alternatives.

The bread was soggy which, when combined with the disgusting chicken made our sandwiches inedible.  My co worker and I ended up throwing both of our lunches away.  We were also told they no longer are making beignets, which we came to really enjoy.

Other people brought the drinks, brought out the food, & cleaned up. I thought he'd be more accessible with so little to do. \n\nThe chicken I ordered was dry, & the sauce was very overpowering. I never tasted the chicken, only felt the over cooked texture. My friend's pasta was better than my chicken, & cost half as much.

3,"Being a local, i'm not gonna be staying at hotels very often.I comped a room at The Venetian and since i had the weekend off, decided to take advantage.I stayed in a Luxury Suite in the Venetian Tower.The room was great.Nice living room area, comfortable bed, 3 TVs(chilling in the tub and watching Mike Tyson's Greatest Hits on ESPN was awesome), epic couch, etc.I had a great view of Wynn Staff parking lot and what appeared to be the Venetian employee parking.It was free so i guess i can't really complain.Just a little disappointed I wasn't able to stand naked in front of the window and have people from the other tower or other hotel gawk at my manliness.\n\nThe property itself is amazing, being only 2nd to Bellagio.It has a classy ambience to it.There seems to be always something going on there.A great selection of restaurants, bars and the epic Tao Nightclub.I had a free line pass and admission to Tao but i showed up around 2:45am and they weren't letting anymore people in.A great time to be walking around the casino, as you get a great view of hot chicks walking around barefoot(for those of you with foot fetishes).I was a little too inebriated to go to pool, so i will have to check that out next time.Had a great time there and would actually be willing to pay for it next time.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning, i ordered a pizza via in-room dining and I was told it would take about 35-40 minutes.Not true at all...it came in 20 minutes!When i opened the door I was shocked to see the clone of one of the greatest Heavyweight Mixed Martial Artists of all time, Fedor Emelianenko.the resemblance is fucking uncanny.If you are an MMA fan, make sure to order food late at night and catch a glimpse of Fedor's twin, Radek.",163602
0,"I am really disappointed in this place, but they are just around the corner and we keep hoping. HAHAHA! This time is the last! They just keep getting worse and worse. The selection is pathetic unless you get there immediately after they cook their donuts. Which appears to be once a day, some time in the morning. Otherwise, they're not fresh. To boot, they insist a bear claw is some kind of apple-filled monstrosity. In addition to the numerous times we have gotten what were supposed to be filled donuts and they had only a DOT of filling, the latest is donuts that they can't even bother cooking all the way. They tasted like wet dough  because they WERE WET DOUGH! These people are nice enough but they seem to not give a damn that the quality is TERRIBLE! Raise your standards, Arizona, a little, for crying out loud: Just because it's a fried carb does NOT mean you have to give it five stars.",472707

0,"Too bad can't indicate zero. Used a Groupon. Food was poor, service indifferent.  Decor takes you back to the 80s but not in a good way (like a banquet hall of a Holiday Inn in Muncie Indiana).  Had fun surprise of additional charges on my credit card which I had to dispute.  \n\nIf you want good tapas / Spanish food, go to Tapas Papas Fritas.",105021
4,My family and I ate here on 9/11/2014 for the first time. I will cut to the chase and just say this place is delicious. I ordered the kebabs and my brother got the Gyro Plate with an appetizer hummus/pita. The flavors are wonderful and the salad dressing is oh so tasty. The owners were nice and lets just say we will be back to eat here again. I will be bringing my own container to buy that wonderful dressing for home :),428044
2,"I was introduced to this restaurant when I use to work in the OC.  I love this chain compared to Olive Garden.  Every time I have been to a Maggiano's whether it is OC or here, I always seem to wait a little.  Just my luck probably.  We like the atmosphere and the food is good.  Below are the usual that we order:\n\nAppetizers: Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms\nPastas: Spaghetti Meatball, Fettuccine Alfredo, Lasagna\nDesserts: Creme Brulee, Tiramisu\n\nPastas are very well prepared as well, but our favorites that keep us coming back are the appetizers and desserts.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to.\n\nThe only thing that was a turn off for us for this location was that the outdoor dining we had to put up with someone that was smoking at a nearby table.  We have kids so this was rather inconvenient.",192184
1,"Wanted to like this, but no. For a bit of background, my husband is half Lebanese and we've eaten our fair share of Middle Eastern food of all stripes and varieties. For really good Middle Eastern food in that part of the city, try Fatoush. Little hole in the wall run by an Iraqi man (I think).\n\nAnyways, this place. Honestly the only reason it gets 2 stars is because hubby liked several of the dishes that I didn't try, like the kafta. First of all, when we ordered water to go with the meal, they brought us bottled water and then charged us for it. EVERY other restaurant I've ever been to in my life has either correctly assumed that I wanted a glass of water, or asked me to clarify whether I wanted bottled water or not. When the waitress turned up a few minutes later, we asked for glasses of water. After she conferred with someone in the back, we got glasses of lukewarm tap water- with no ice.\n\nAnd then, the food. Granted, at a Mediterranean buffet, I expect mostly Mediterranean food, but here even that was too much to ask. Of the four buffet tables full of food, maybe one and a half was food I would have considered Mediterranean, and even some of that was a stretch. Some of the dishes in the buffet included: lasagna (looked frozen), alfredo (gummy and bland), pasta with chicken (just strange), zucchini fries (obviously frozen), fried okra (?), spring rolls (frozen), orange Jell-o squares (huh?). The rice pilaf was too salty and had Jalapeno peppers in it(?). As for the actual Mediterranean food, the stuffed grape leaves were the best of the bunch. As I mentioned, hubby liked the kafta but it was a bit spicy for me. The hummus was bitter- too much tahini. The chicken schwarma tasted like someone tried to alter a recipe for chicken parmesan. Really, the best section overall was the salads. The tabbouleh was decent although it needed more salt to counteract all of the lemon juice. And one other salad had huge chunks of feta cheese in it- the feta was strong and flavorful.\n\nOverall, there is NO way I'd go back here, even with another Groupon.",559626
0,"If you them to be out of what you want, paying for your order to be made wrong or to wait in a drive through for 20-30 minutes, go to this location.  8 or 9 times out of ten these things will happen.

1,"I've stayed at Caesar's Palace several times and always order to go from Noodle No.9.\nWhen ordering to go, the service is always professional, the food excellent.\nThis time i decided to dine-in. My only explanation for the lack of good service would be that it must be a cultural one. The staff is pretty professional - but i never saw one smile. And when i would ask for a substitution, it was met with much resistance. Then, when ordering desert, i was in a hurry and wanted my ice cream to go, they said they wouldn't - i was like \""put it in a dixie cup!\"" But i do have to say - the atmosphere is amazing and the food is great - i just think the entire staff needs to go through an american customer service training - ASAP!",369194
2,"This place has a ton of flat screens around the bar and throughout the restaurant, with a huge projection screen in another raised enclave.  There is an outdoor bar with surrounding tables but I didn't notice any tv screens outside.  The seats @ the indoor bar suck, so I lobbied for a booth.  (The bar seats were like retro, high chairs that lacked a back you could lean into a lil too high, even for my legs).\n\nHappy hour included a few 1/2 priced appetizers that the waitress highlighted.  She also provided a thorough explanation of speechless communication that would ensure our miller lites continued.  If you face the empty bottle @ the end of the table with the label facing outward, she'd pick up the empties for replacement.  I only forgot about this rule once & received a fresh bottle while I still had a 1/4 bottle left.\n\nNo clue how much the beers were but the deal seemed pretty good, since we had @ least 10 beers & an appetizer for $30.  The folks there seemed to run a tidy & expedient little operation and overall my experience was a'ight.",322151
4,"Love love love this place! Came here w my BFF. Found it on yelp. Service was fantastic. Above and beyond. Not only did they do a great mani pedi for my friends but they also gave me a VIP room w blanket, an awesome bed to rest in and TV while I was waiting. The manager  even offered to feed my fruit. Ha. Love love love this place. I woulda given it 10 stars if it was possible!!!",440330
1,"The only reason this place is getting 2stars is for the beer SELECTION, not the prices. And as all the other Yelpers, we so wanted to love this place, but just can't. My husband doesn't like it when he knows I'm going to give a bad review because he feels bad for them, BUT the whole point is to help these people figure it out! During our visit, we decided pretty quickly that we probably would not be coming back, so hopefully these reviews are taken seriously & with consideration. I will give the atmosphere and decor a 4 star, it's cute and has a nice set up with a lot of potential. And here comes the big but again, BUT you can't serve overpriced crappy food with great beer. You can't have a team that doesn't know anything about your great beer selection & brings you the wrong samplers. You can't have them correcting you multiple times on how to pronounce a beer if they get it wrong!! You can't have them give you the wrong tables check at the end of service. You can't have them wipe down a wet table while your seated with another wet, disgusting bar towel & then make you wait while they search for a dry one to finish the job. You just can't do any of those things & expect repeat customers. The food was bad, really bad! And when you are talking about the great beer, why would we come here if we could go right down the street to a Brewery who also has great food & beer that isn't overpriced! Let me say, we don't have a problem paying high prices for great beers or great food or great service, but when you miss on all counts, it felt like a waste of money. Perch you need to sit down with the greeters, chefs and the servers and have a pow wow, ASAP! Sorry for this BUT I just couldn't accept not writing this review. :(",621785
0,"This is by far the worst restaurant experience that I have ever encountered so far. I've driven by Sevens' plenty of times before they opened, looked them up online and was excited to try them out. Their menu looked really good and tasty. I finally got around to having dinner there this past weekend. The menu you see on their website for lunch & dinner is not what you'll see when you go in. Online, they combine both their lunch and dinner menus making it appear larger. But when we were there on a Friday night around 7, we were only given the dinner menu which was about half the size. Now that I'm looking at their menu online, the prices are also not accurate. It's probably because they're showing the lunch prices which are typically lower.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was dead. There were a few people at the bar and two other tables. We were seated inside the restaurant close to the patio. They had the patio doors open making it way too cold. Some heat lamps were definitely needed. Good thing I wore a leather jacket. The restaurant is really well decorated, clean, and modern. I didn't see what it used to look like as Avalon so I don't know how much they remodeled. We were greeted and seated right away.\n\nWe got the monkey bread and spinach and artichoke dip to start for 5 of us. The monkey bread was raw. At first we thought it was gooey cheese, no it was raw dough. Bleh! We told the waiter and he took it away and later brought us out a new one. The new one was clearly burnt. I didn't even bother trying it. The small piece of the first one I had was okay. Tasted similar to Red Lobster's cheesey biscuits with some honey. I thought it was supposed to have garlic butter? The spinach and artichoke dip came out on a huge plate. However, there were probably 8 wedges of pita to go with it. The dip was edible but way too garlicy. There needs to be more pita for the proportion of dip though. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the duck sliders to split and the lemon basil chicken. Other people got burgers, duck sliders, and french onion soup. The duck sliders were okay. I took the onion, cilantro, jalapeno off because I don't like them. We also asked for the spicy mayo sauce to be on the side. Good thing we asked if it came with a sauce since it didnt' say on the menu. If your familiar with those pork buns you can get at he Asian Bakeries for $2, that's pretty much what it tasted like. Good but not worth $12. My boyfriend at the sandwich with the condiments on it and said that it didn't go well together at all. The chips are those kinds you get at the fair. However, just looking at them, you can tell that they were drenched in the cooking oil. They were so soggy and flimsy. How did the cook see that and think it looked appetizing? Another person got the duck sliders which came out 15 minutes later for some reason and the chips were just as soggy. Our meals didn't really come out at the same time but I guess I'd rather get it right away than have it sitting under a heat lamp. The fries that come with the burger are similar to those from Steak and Shake (thin-cut/shoe string fries). Those were probably the best thing out of the whole meal. I was told that the burgers were good. Our lemon chicken was horrible. I've never had to return something back to the kitchen before but it just wasn't good and not worth $20. It was really sour (not sweet and sour, just sour) and the chicken was really rubbery. The chicken was in little strips, I was expecting an actual piece of chicken breast that you usually get at restaurants.\n\nOur drinks sometimes went empty but other than that our waiter was really nice and accommodating. He didn't question that the monkey bread was raw or that we didn't like our dish. \n\nI don't think any of us will ever go back. There are just too many other options in Old Town that are so much better. What a shame.\n\nGot a message from Jake J. probably someone who has a share in the restaurant since he posted those professional photos. An average diner wouldn't have access to those. Here's what he's got to say: \""Got love the complainers. They always have yelp accounts. I had to write once I saw your review. Monkey bread is my favorite and it is not raw in the middle it is melted cheese. Figured you would know that with your advanced pallet or see it with your own eyes. Can't please everyone. Ive been there so many times never had one complaint nor heard one around me until this stupid site that have so called \""wanna be food critics\"" didn't momma teach u anything..... If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. Guess not. Typical \""yelper\""\"" Funny because he has written unfavorable reviews in the past, some even promoting Sevens'.

4,"Great Harvest's bread and customer service @ Rea Road is over-the-top!  The staff who work there are always friendly and go the extra mile for the customer.  I stopped by to pick up two gluten free bread loaves they had on hold for me; my wife is gluten intolerant, but not allergic.  While talking with the to person behind the desk (later found out to be one of the owners), they encouraged me to try a loaf of their spelt bread. She explained that it is similar to wheat but has a different protein, and often people who think they are intolerant to gluten, can often eat Great Harvest's spelt loafs because they are made with great, wholesome ingredients.  Wow did the spelt bread taste good!  My wife had no reaction to it either.  Our next step is to try some of their wheat loafs.  We are so excited that my wife may have the option of eating real bread again!  Thank you Great Harvest Bread Company @ Rea Road.",419322

I came here and was happy to order chicken Marsala and hear a few minutes latter the chief pounding chicken cutlets, reminded me of home. Fresh and on point, the Alfredo is out of this world and the pizzas are the same. They have a large brick over to cook there pizza and the pizza comes out thin crust as if it was made in a bakers pride oven. Don't let the outside deter you, once inside it is a very modern romantic look with a few tables. Great date spot or place to pick up to go. One last thing, every time I go to Pizza a metro the service is some of the best I've experienced in the food industry.",320691

I only ordered sushi, which was decent. Not the best I ever had, but OK.\n\nAnother thing to note is that this place doesn't have a full bar - beer and wine only. Annoying! WTF!?!? I thought this was Vegas! How can you not have a full bar?!?!\n\nService is OK. A little slow. The hibachi guys are really great and entertaining. \n\nHonestly, I don't know if I would go here again.

We had no problems checking in or out. \n\nThere was one problem in that we had our do not disturb sign on the door all weekend but when we came back from a pool party on saturday we came into the room and one bed had been made. First, we had the do not disturb sign on because we didn't really need the room cleaned. Second, if someone was coming into the room to clean it, I would have locked my things up in my suitcase.

0,"Up until about two months ago I was a big fan of Friday's, especially this location. I went there a couple of months ago and waited at the front. And waited. And waited. There were about ten people waiting to be seated, and we had stood there for nearly 15 minutes. One person wiping tables looked up and saw us all standing there, and went back to wiping tables. We left and went to the hotel buffet.\n\nAbout a month later we went back. No problem getting seated this time. The problem was getting waited on. We sat at the table for nearly 15 minutes and no one approached us. Finally, as we were about to walk out the door, the waitress came by and handed us menus. She said she would be \""right back\"" with our drinks. Another 15 minutes passed (the place wasn't terribly busy). By this time I was fuming - and I'm usually pretty calm and tolerant about these things. Finally - 45 minutes after we were seated - we got to place our order. When the food arrived it was overcooked and dry.\n\nAdd bad service to the significant price increases throughout the Friday's chain ($16.95 for a dish with two pieces of chicken?

As a main, I had the meatballs, which had a good taste, but once again were not hot enough. My friend ordered a salad and opted to get the grilled shrimp. For $5 she got three shrimp, which isn't a bad deal, I guess. But it kicked the cost of the entire salad to $12, and it wasn't worth it at that price.\n\nThe service was OK. Our server was friendly, and while he didn't apologize for the slow service or cold food, one got the feeling that it wasn't his fault and the kitchen was having issues.

I ended up going to best buy and was in and out in 15 minutes including activating my service.  Like I said I'm happy with sprint an will continue to support them its just a shame on how bad the retail store is!",68207
1,Pool service is terrible. Took 30 plus minutes for drink orders. We also went to Centro Lounge for dinner and service was ALSO slow! Good lord,360672
4,The Service Manager Keith contacted me and worked directly with me.  He was understanding and acknowledged the concerns.  He took in my car and worked to make the corrections.  My car is fixed and no longer has alignment issues.  Definitely satisfied with their response and I will stay a customer.,447917
1,"Came here last night for a friends bachelor party.  I wasn't that impressed with the club in comparison to XS.  Basically, one level is all booths and the next level is the dance floor (but was kind of like a maze trying to get around the joint).   They had a local dj playing, so nothing great, they might have gotten an extra star if they had a better dj playing.  I just think the overall design blew, plus the drinks were crazy expensive, but that's expected at any club in Vegas.  Would I go here again?  Hell no!!  XS or Marquee is the only way to go in Vegas, just my 2 cents!",597210
3,The new terminal is great!,603950
1,"Very dive-y looking in the front.\nWe decided to try it out a few months ago when I was pregnant.\nWasn't terribly impressed. We ordered a meat plate/sampler, that just had the meat and cheese thrown on there. When our pizza finally came, there was a pool of grease sitting on top of it. I've had it better frozen, out of a box.\n\nFor whatever reason, we decided to give them a second chance, with delivery, about a month later.\n\nThere was a mile long black hair baked into our pizza. NO thanks, never again.",118398
3,"Nothing says\""Welcome to Vegas\"" quite like a casino set up inside the airport!  It seems like as soon as you get off the plane you're hit with the blinking lights and ding ding of the slot machines.  \n\nBut seriously, let's get to the important part.  FREE Wifi!!!  Do I need to say anymore about that?\n\nThe other important part, the food choices.  I hate when the only thing offered in an airport is fast food options or sit down restaurants.  I want a nice balance that's fast and not fried.  There weren't many of those choices, unless you wanted to grab a pre-made sandwich from one of those corner grab and go stations.  Meh.  Good thing was you can scrounge up something and at least there are options.  I've been to some airports were there's hardly anything in the terminal you're parking it at for 2 plus hours.  Thee worst!\n\nAnother plus, it's literally minutes from The Strip.  Being from a city (Pittsburgh) that has an airport more than 20 minutes outside the city limits, that's a big plus!  I want to get to the party fast and leave all my \""sins\"" quickly:)",119585
3,"Tried the salmon wrap and Julia tried the caprese panini. \n\nThe food was excellent! Great flavors, nice presentation.  And it came with a refreshing side salad.   I will be back!!\n\nThe downside is the ambiance. Very plain inside.  Not much to look at.  Boring music. The server lacked enthusiasm about the food.  I think they should be more excited about they are producing.",513956
2,"Some of the BBQ was great!  But some of the lines were so long that getting up to the booth was almost impossible. There were many booths that we didn't try, because we couldn't get near them. Even the lines to get food and drink tickets were long. Not enough volunteers?\n\nFood and drink tickets were $2 - and a few places had samples for $2. That's what we were looking for - samples to try as many different  local BBQ places as we could. But many places had only full meals or sandwiches. We could have just gone to a BBQ restaurant anywhere in town and had a nice cool sit-down BBQ meal. But that wasn't the point. \n\nThe point was to try what AZ has to offer in the way of BBQ. \n\nAlso, someone needs to tell the vendors that next year they should have a sign up in the back of their tent giving their storefront location. When we tried something we liked, we had to inquire as to where they were located in town. \n\nMarketing folks! Marketing! Especially if you want folks to find your restaurant.\n\nAlso, whomever came up with the idea of stand in this line to order and move over to that line to pick-up must have not been using their noodles. Even fast food joints make you show a receipt or ticket that you have paid. If you were standing in the pick-up line here you got food. \n\nNo questions asked. Not a good business model . . . even for one day.\n\nIs this an annual event? Well, if so, someone needs to work on the logistics before next year.  A lot could be done to make this an event that really shows off the valley BBQ community. It kind of had the feeling of being thrown together at the last minute. Was it?\n\nNeeded more shade. Needed more places to sit and eat. The band needed shade. This is AZ folks. The sun is hot.\n\nOh, yeah, parking was free and seemed to be very well organized!",558581
0,"Was hoping that this one would be quicker than the one on Flamingo. Given that it was a Sunday and there was only one other customer, we thought we got lucky. Unfortunately, it took quite a bit to flag down the employee and finally make eye contact. I told him we tried to make an appointment but the sprint app is useless and kept erroring out and would not let us login. He said he would be with us in 5 minutes. After 15, we had to give up and leave or we would have been late to work. Now we have to spend the next couple of days with a brand new phone that cannot power on because we cannot spare the hours it takes to go and wait at a sprint store.",69843

Its a really chill atmosphere which I really like!\n\nEric is the best bartender. Hes awesome! Always on top of everything and always recommending really good food. He has awesome stories too. Really cool guy! Keep it up boss!\n\nMontana meat company is awesome!",289336
0,"Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \""multiple times\"" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \""Oh, you wanted another?\"" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated.",3589
3,"Very late review... For reasons to be a bit clearer in a moment. Definitely a hipster vibe as others have pointed out YET more inclusive than a crappy Chicago dive bar any day of the week.\n\nI visited during a trip I made on Labor Day weekend, just to cash in some miles and get away from the above mentioned city and its 1/3 of a summer we experienced this year. Seriously, felt like spring never ended, no Indian summer and straight into snow this week. I digress. I was genuinely concerned I'd run into the local Yelpers for whom I've had a long standing feud (although I noticed certain arch members have dropped off the face of online Yelp terra) yet I soldiered on. My concerns were lifted when I noticed a) how crowded it was. b) how young the crowd was and c) it was noticeably a hip hop night with DJ to boot. As inclusive as they pretend to be I'd never imagine to see the Yelp crowd that I knew at an \""urban\"" music setting. This proved to be the busiest venue that weekend as Phoenix was, as usual, an utter ghost town and historically so on both Memorial and Labor Day weekends - hence, the perfect weekend for a visit. I wanted to concentrate on visiting my favorite spots of old.\n\nSo, to summarize: SideBar is still open, and not taken over by some corporate chain. It's still open late nights. It hasn't lost its good atmosphere, even though it was too crowded for me that night. I am happy the Phx is retaining some culture without the CenPho idiots inserting themselves into everything nor making a pointless cause out of a new bar or restaurant constantly.",361303
2,"This was our first time at Grape Street and we were with people that come here quite a bit.\n\nI like the restaurant itself, the chairs are REALLY comfortable.  There are three options of places to sit: at a table, at the bar or outside.\n\n-1 Star: it's CRAZY dark inside!  I had to use my phone light to read the menu (im in my 20's people, so my eyes are still good!)  Definitely not a place to take someone on your first date since you won't be able to check them out.\n\n-2 Star: our waiter was a \""close talker\"" and kinda freaked me out.  He was nice but for some reason I didn't really care for him.  He was super slow with everything.  At the end of dinner, we asked to split the bill and they said that they couldn't.  So we asked if we could give them two credit cards, and they said yes.  Why didn't they offer that option to us?\n\nAnother Con: they brought out two dishes and probably 3 minutes later brought out the other two.  Kinda weird that the two people just sat there until the other two people were served.  Not sure why they did that.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered the Mussels: New Zealand mussels saut\u00e9ed in either red or white wine sauce and baked with parmesan cheese.  Its on the app menu, but we ordered it for our main course.  We had it with the white sauce and it had very good flavor, just a little overcooked as they were chewy.  \n\nOur one friend ordered the Jumbo Cheese Ravioli: romano, mozzarella & ricotta cheese ravioli topped with a pink sauce.  This is what he orders there all the time and says its good!\n\nOur other friend ordered Angel Hair Primavera: vegetables with pine nuts & fresh herbs in either red or white sauce.  She ordered the red sauce and said it was good.\n\nI think for the four of us, four drinks the bill came to $85 and change.  Our friends had a coupon for 20% off that was given to them the last time they were at the restaurant.\n\nI think I will definitely go again.  More wine next time and maybe an appetizer!",70297
2,"Decent food we went for breakfast but I was told i could order off the lunch menu. I tried the chicken sandwich with sliced apples the sandwich was good bread was fresh. The service was good we sat outside. Lots of reviews for this place I guess worth trying out for breakfast/lunch. Nothing out of this world I have to say but goof to grab a quick salad, or sandwich and sit outside to people watch. Also ordered escargot was ok nothing special came out with no bread. had to wait 7 minutes the guy said they were baking the baguettes. The bread was actually excellent !",168050
2,"I've biked past Union Grill countless times as its $10 wine list sign blinks tauntingly but never stopped until recently.\n\nBesides the $10 wine list (yes, Union Grill has about 8+ different bottles of wine to choose from all for $10), Union Grill is known for its burgers. \n\nThese half-pound burgers are made from dry-aged ribeye, sirloin, brisket and chuck, which are then ground into a burger. Burgers are accompanied by lettuce, tomato, onions, and a dill pickle and served with your choice of cole slaw, waffle fries, sweet potato chips, vegetable of the day, or rosted garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nEven though the Five-hour Pot Roast was so very tempting, I went with the Blue UG. It came topped with imported English Stilton Blue Cheese and the accouterments. I choose waffle fries as my side and also the Homemade Steakburger Sauce.\n\nWhile I waited I entertained myself with some of that $10 wine. Always a good choice in my book. The burger came out a smidge more done than I asked (medium) but the quality made up for that. The flavor of the beef was exceptional. You can tell no pink goo was used in crafting this behemoth. This thing was thick and juicy (the bun suffered a bit) and as a result I committed one of my cardinal sins: I cut the burger in half. Gasp. I quickly got over it. The blue cheese was mild and creamy as it melted and the steakburger sauce (tasted like a richer, and spicier A1 sauce) really pulled the whole thing together. The waffle fries were tasty but didn't seem like they were made on-site.\n\nIt was throughly enjoyable and hit my burger craving spot oh so right.\n\nUnion Grill's menu has classic American favorites like Turkey Devonshire and Tuna Melts, and the atmosphere is friendly, inviting, and reminds you a 1980's game room (in a good way). These reasons plus more are why it was jam-packed with diners at 9 p.m. and will continue to be so for a long time to come. I'll be back... for that pot roast. You can count on that.",150356
4,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was extremely attentive, the room felt luxurious enough to warrant the price (we were in the Tower, an upgrade we made at checkin for a very sweet deal). I loved the bathrobes and flirted with the idea of buying one until I saw the tag in the hotel store (200 dollars, alas).\n\nThe more secluded pool you get when you upgrade was very nice and not crowded, with prompt service by the extremely helpful eyecandy, I mean staff.\n\nOur room deal included tickets to Le Reve, which was incredible. If you have a chance to see it I highly recommend you do. Much better than O in my opinion, but in a similar vein, combining dance and gymnastics and diving, with artistry in the visual effects that is mind blowing.\n\nWe also ate at their breakfast buffet, at 10:45 which it turns out is a good time to go- you can eat both the breakfast and lunch menus as they transition over. The bottomless margaritas were a good deal, since we definitely got into the spirit of the \""bottomless\"" part.  I was very impressed at the variety of dishes, and how good they were considering it was a buffet. I'm trying to remember what we had, but the names of specific dishes seem to have been drowned in the sea of OJ and bubbly.\n\nThe casino did NOT smell like cigarette smoke, which is always a plus for me. We only saw it as we passed through, as we weren't there to gamble.\n\nSave up your $$$ and give it a try.",132428
4,"Looking for a place to pass some time while waiting for a flight, then this is the place.  I like the comfortable environment to relax between flight and the service from the team here is great.

3,"Being new to Las Vegas, the search is on for certain restaurants that are \""musts\"" while I'm here. \nA good Chinese joint is crtical, and the mission has been accomplished.\nThey've got a very good lunch special for $5.55 (described above). \nI recommend the BBQ Pork Appetizer. It's a little different than I've had before, coming covered with a honey sauce, but it's very good.\nSweet & Sour Chicken is good, fried rice is solid. It's going to be a weekly stop for me.",123307
1,"I loved the food that wasn't the problem,  it was the service.  I asked for water two different times and he comes back fifteen minutes later and asked me if I wanted water.  That pissed me off.  I also don't like it that you have to order an entree in order to get chips and salsa.  That's a staple at mexican restaurants where I come from and there are many in Las Vegas that will give you chips and salsa before your meal.  They want to charge you otherwise.",357162
2,"Good burger. Made to order right on the charcoal grill. You select your patty size and type of cheese.  Customize your own burger with basic condiments.  Add fries and a drink.\n\nCustomer service, nonexistent. The cashier didn't even say thank you when I handed him a tip.\n\nThe store itself was hot and muggy. It felt like it was hotter inside than outside, and outside was over 104 degrees!\n\nOverall, a decent burger but not worth it.",113728

2,"I ended up heading here after an awesome review in the Isthmus. My dad was in town heading to a hockey game with my brother and me. I thought I'd bring the boys here since I wanted to try it and it wasn't as busy as some of the college hang-outs (e.g. The Nitty). The food was good and the servers were kind, but it was a little small and not a lot of variety on the menu. We all got burgers/sandwiches, and they were tasty, but nothing out of this world. I would head back soon for the bar, however, as they have great drink specials, and the staff was nice. Cool bar.",525681
3,"We had tickets to see Bill Maher who was performing at the Palms Hotel.  We walked all around the hotel and we weren't coming up with a place to eat.  All we wanted to do was grab a quick bite and some drinks.  One of the hotel staff recommended Heraea, so we tried it.  On a whole the food and service was up to par and generally was served quickly and correctly. \n\nI'm not giving this review 5 stars because it was really nuts in there when we were there trying to have a relaxed bite.  March Madness was in full swing and patrons were really into cheering loudly and clapping hands, high fiving etc. in response to which game on what TV they were cheering for.  It was almost competitive when it came to who could yell louder.  That's hard on your nerves when you are trying to have a relaxed dinner. \n\nTake note, have no doubt, this is a sports bar and fans will yell and cheer when their teams are doing good and when their teams are doing poorly.",594390
2,"After enjoying I Love Lucy Live Onstage at the Knight Theatre uptown hubby and I decided to stop into Amelie's for hot beverages and pastries since it was close by. What was our experience?:  just average. First of all it's such a small space. There is hardly room to move around or even to sit if there are more than a hand full of people there, and since it became crowded quickly after we arrived we just felt like getting out of there. It's a cute little space, but there was nothing fabulous about it to me. My hot chocolate and pastry were okay, but I don't know that I'd return. There are other options to consider where I would feel more comfortable and relaxed. After all, isn't that why you go to a coffee shop?",475711
2,"Meh.... I went here with my boss on a business trip.  I just don't understand why anyone would want to eat a hamburger while at Vegas.  I have been to this one and the one in San Francisco and I am not impressed with either of them.

3,"Have not been here this year.My experience of roughly 20 visits was always good with zero problems or complaints. I enjoyed many different things. It was never fast but not a problem. Always clean, orders correct and polite. No drive through experience. I enjoyed everything and liked trying things.",250714
1,Got a great deal via Hotel Tonight so it's off to Imperial Palace. From scanning review here I wasn't expecting much and my expectations were met. The place needs a refresh badly though they seem to try and keep it clean. It took 90 minutes to check in on Sunday afternoon. They were nice enough to pass out small bottles of water but I would have preferred adding more staff to get everyone checked in. The woman that checked me in was friendly and helpful but not very speedy. With the line as ugly as it was you'd think they'd try to keep the chit chat down. When I was done with my 90 minutes in purgatory I noticed the line was even longer than when I hit the door. I'm betting some folks were easily in for a 2 hour wait.\n\nThe room was okay with carpet needing replacement but the room was clean given the poor overall condition of the infrastructure. I'd stay here again if the rate was cheap enough but I wouldn't go out of my way to book a room here. You can't beat the overall value given the location on the strip and the normal cheap rates they've been putting out.,167027
3,Great Sesame bagel! It is a little sweeter and less hard than NYC bagels but they are great. Definitely eat them while they are hot because that is the best. I still think NY Bagels are the bomb :),330525
1,"The food is ok,but the service needs to be improved. Waiting to get seated could take up to 20 minutes. Then having your order get taken takes another 10 minutes.\n\nI noticed that there are quite a few complaints here for the service and it's understaffed situation, but evidently the establishment doesn't think it's a problem.",470423

1,"Poor excuse for an airport. Location makes it prone to high winds, and thus delays. \n\nThe place is pretty filthy as well. \n\nI had to make a connection here. Due to delays I had to run to the gate. Directions to the gate were nonexistent. I had to breathlessly ask an airline attendant for help. Well, after i kind of figured out where to go, i realized that this was the worst setup ever. i had to go through unmarked doors, down stairs, and wait on what looked like a loading dock for a shuttle bus to take me to the correct gate. what?",119118
4,"My first experience with Ethiopian food! I was hesitant, as it is a cuisine I knew little-to-nothing about, but holy moly - I was so surprised. Four girlfriends and I ordered the vegetarian exclusive (I believe it's called) which is meant for three people, so we also ordered the vegetarian platter meant for one. We hardly finished the exclusive, there was so much food! Everything is SO tasty. I was worried about the injera, as I have friends who don't like the consistency of it. I really loved the fresh sourdough taste of it, though, especially mixed with the flavors of the different wats. \n\nAfter my first visit, I was so excited to take my boyfriend there - we made dinner plans with friends of ours within two weeks of my first trip! I absolutely LOVE Lalibela and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite stops for delicious vegetarian food!",110479
2,"When I want Mexican, I don't automatically think of Macayo's.  Do I know they are there? Yes.  Do I immediately think of anything at all on their menu I'd like to eat? No, not at all.  The food just isn't very good and if it is memorable in any way it is because it isn't good.\n\nWe ended up here today because a friend wanted to meet up for drinks.  The bar was clean and our server, even though she was new, did well taking care of us.  Everyone at the table had either tap or bottled beer, except me, and had no complaints.\n\nI had a 65th anniversary special margarita.  It was big and refreshing... It also cost $10!  Was it worth ten bucks? No! But it was far better than the $7 margarita made with crappy booze... But I only had one as I find the cost highly prohibitive.\n\nThe table shared a plate of deep fried green chili strips off the Chili Harvest menu and they were quite good.  I don't like that they were fried... I think of frying as something one does when they don't have the skills to appropriately showcase the flavor of the item... But they were still good!\n\nThe biggest complaint at the table was the fact that there was no tangible happy hour offering... They once had a happy hour food spread, but not today... They had half price appetizers off the regular menu (the seasonal menu was not included)... But no buffet... Why?  \n\nDrinks and a happy hour buffet are why we were there, now there is little reason to return...",251681
2,"I have pretty much come to the conclusion that these wings are the fast food of wings. Not that they try to present themselves otherwise but I just get a very generic feel from these wings.\n\nI will say that the service at this location is top notch. The cashier taking orders was very nice and made sure to clarify what I had ordered before she put the order in. I ordered three chicken strips with original hot sauce and fries with a side of cheese sauce. The strips were just okay. I would not go out of my way to order them again. The fries were the same. The cheese sauce that came with them was overall pretty bland. My true issue lies with the amount of salt that is used in everything here. Way too much salt. It became overpowering halfway through my meal. As one of the other reviewers said, I could also taste sugar in the fries which is just completely unnecessary. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back to Wing Stop. There are certainly many other better alternatives for wings in the area. I might consider trying something else here but not any time soon.",627349

WOOHEE!\n\nGot there early, sat in their outdoor patio bar, bought a couple of ice cold beers, and chased it with fresh delish mojitos and had appetizers.  \n\nGolf prices here is at the high end but worth it if you come to Scottsdale once in awhile.

Since we were all sharing, the waiter offered to add an extra shrimp to the cocktail - to make 4 (1 for each - they are BIG). He did the same for the other appetizers. Nice touch, made it so we all could have a little taste of each.\n\nFood is served entree and large \""\u00c0 la carte\"" sides - like any good restaurant should. We again split all the sides - with waiter making sure there was plenty for each.\n\nI ordered a margarita (rocks/salt) - came in a 'girly' wide-top glass. I did ask for a normal tall drink bar glass on my refills...waiter obliged with no problems.\n\nOverall - good place for an adult date-night. We will definitely go back.",328300
1,"First of all don't buy more than one yelp coupon at a time cause you can only use one at a time and they stated that they prefer to give one ticket per table. Now I'm stuck with 2 more coupons that I probably won't use. The salsa was a little hot for me but the chips were fresh and delicious. We got the cheddar quest and it was delicious as well. I was very exited for the creamed corn side dish and it was a little hot for me but was delicious and I ate it even though my nose was running from it. I ordered the quesadilla and it was just basically plain chicken and cheese. Finally something not burning my mouth. My dinner guests had the Barbacoa burrito, which was huge, and the tilapia Cesar salad which looked good. Everyone ate all of their food! The service is where this place goes down hill. Had to wave her down for everything and wasn't overly friendly. If your going for the food it's pretty good just don't go there looking for the best service.",485441
4,"I visited Jobing.com for the Kiss concert earlier this week. I previously visited a few years ago when the Dancing with the Stars tour came to town. The arena is very clean, I found parking to be a breeze and the staff great. Some coworkers told me to expect $20 for parking. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was no charge. My friend and I arrived early and had time to go to the Yardhouse close by. Having neighboring food and drink establishments close by helps save money on the inside. \n\nMy seats to the show were on the floor and ushers showed us the way. Although the tickets said no camera allowed, fans had cameras and cell phones. Security allowed people to walk to the stage with their camera, while the band members walked over and posed while playing. As long as fans stayed for only a couple of minutes and were orderly, security approved. The seats were good, the atmosphere great and it was maybe the best show I have ever seen.\n\nI found getting out of the arena was good. Police guided the way, directed traffic with a descent flow and it was a quick drive to the highway. Great night and an enjoyable venue!",116085

0,"The hotel has a very confusing layout. Had to go to the back of the hotel to mess around with the parking. The parking garage is very small and confusing. The lobby was like entering a set of a 1970s tv show. Mirror chandeliers and out dated carpet. The check in line was very long and they only had 4 people checking guests in. I requested top floor and only got 17! I received 5749. I said there was no way that the room was on the 57th floor because the building didn't even look like it past 20 floors. We walked to the elevators which are beyond outdated. Scratched and scrapped up gold walls and Mirrors, doors and floors. I looked at the wall of buttons to push my floor and it had numbers 47-61? With arrows and other room numbers. I pushed 57 which is where my room was.  Got off and the sign in the hall said 17th floor but all the other signage says 57 but clearly we were not 57 stories high above the Vegas nightlife. It is extremely confusing and makes no friggin sense. That's all I ever heard the other guests complain about. The room we got was a \""luxury\"" in the \""renovated\"" Monoco tower. \""Renovated is an understatement! I think the last time it was update was in the 90's. The carpet on the halls was stained. The room doors are an old wood type very dark and ugly. The room was worse. It smells like mold as door are you open the door. The room was certainly not \""luxury\"" nor updated. The bathroom was terrible. Ugly old 1970's yellow bathroom tile and shower and old outdated bathroom fixtures. The shower head was the worst I ever had in a hotel. Everything in the room was dirty. The rugs the ceiling in the bathroom stains on the carpet. The desk and the pictures looked like it hadn't been dusted in years! The windows were absolutely disgusting and dirty. The view was pretty good except the view of the ugly buildings and dumpsters but overall it was a nice view. The bed was pretty comfortable I was surprised. The fridge didn't work and we had to tell them 3 times to replace it and they never did! We came one night and there was absolutely no parking! All the garages were filled and even valet was full! The one night we did valet the car it took almost 30 mins to get the car. And they were very short handed.  I didn't have any change to tip on me except a large bill so I went in the hotel to front desk and asked for change and the older lady told me no and I had to walk to the casino which was on the other side of the hotel to the cage to break it. Really? You can't give me some change? I'll never come back to this place. The casino was horrible. They advertise $1 blackjack and only have it On 1 table! Really? And they only had 3-4 other BJ tables but the min was $25. Really? The slots sucked and so did the players club which gave me a. $3.00 crappy shirt for joining and spending all my money in their hotel. The restaurants suck and are fast food places. Please update it. You can still have the history and old charm if you just update the dam place! Absolutely the worst! Save your time and energy and stay and play somewhere else!",133519

3,"This place is great. Best mofungo ever --- the mound was textured with crispy, fried pieces of plantain integrated within the traditional mashed up plantain chunks. I could eat that all on its own. I ordered it with the fried pork chop, which came with the traditional gravy --- delicious. The maduros and boiled yucca were prepared just the way I like it. The garlic sauce for the yucca was potent . . . but again, that's just the way I like it.",347847

I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!) \n\nI think I gave it a fair shake.

Bertha's Cafe is definitely one of those little spots where you can count on getting a quality sandwich or pastry and wash it down with a fresh batch of watermelon lemonade.

Also there is a thrift shop right next door if you have time to kill afterwards!,276840
0,"This place leaves a lot to desired. My dad and I went during the week because he was craving Mexican food. So, I suggested we give Gil's a shot - trying to support local restaurants. \n\nIt was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren't deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). \n\nWe started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. \n\nThen, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. \n\nFor entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. \n\nThe 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's. \n\nAnd my rating is not because I'm comparing this place to normal \""Mexican food\"" places - I know this place is supposed to be \""New Mexican.\"" I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them.",371079

2,"Located next to Amos' Southend, this bar is a nice little retreat if you're looking to get out of Amos' for a bit.\n\nI was at Amos' for a concert one night & was tired of the opening act. So my friend & I headed over to the Gin Mill to check the scores of the game before the main act came on stage. From the moment we walked in, you could tell this place was a sports bar. This probably had to due with the fact that they are a Notre Dame friendly bar, & the Irish were playing, but it still was a very lively atmosphere. With plenty of tvs throughout the place, there wasn't a bad seat in the house to catch the game. I'm not sure if it's always as crazy when the Irish aren't playing, but it was great when they were.\n\nWhile it was a short trip to the Gin Mill, I think it's a great little bar to check out if you're at Amos' and tired of that scene. You can pop into the Gin Mill pretty quickly & grab a drink. And if the Irish are playing, look out.",80466

4,"Delicious food - definitely french influenced, with just the right amount of spice.  The fact that it's BYOB is a huge plus, as these types of restaurants are usually just so much better.  They can't make money on their 350% markup of alcohol, so they really have to do well with the food.  This restaurant did not disappoint, both in service and taste.\n\nThe inside is very small which makes this a pretty intimate place.  My girlfriend and I were clearly having a date night, but there was a row of tables lined up next to us that was set out for a large party.  It's nice when a restaurant can be small enough to have an intimate atmosphere, yet still accommodate a large range of group sizes.   I had the prix fixe menu, which was a LOT of food (so the price tag wasn't unreasonable at all), and every portion of it was delicious.\n\nIf you're visiting Montreal, GO TO THIS PLACE.

1,"I really like the Red Rock Resort.  My friends and I stayed there so that we could do some mtn biking and watch the ncaa tournament in the sports book.  The resort is nice, clean, and not too crowded.  After staying on the strip the last couple of times, this spot is much more convenient.  I'd probably still stay on the strip if I was with my wife though, since there are no shows or fancy restaurants at the Red Rock.\n\nThat being said, I was really disappointed with the Feast Buffet.  It was about $22 which is not expensive, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the food.  I ate a little of everything, and nothing was particularly good.  Sushi was worse than what I can get at my local Ralphs.  The BBQ ribs were dry.  Hardly any fish to chose from.  Asian section was about as good as panda express.  Really, nothing great about it.  I was more excited about the Fat Burger that I got in the casino food court.  Come to think of it, I also got a great prosciutto sandwich in the casino too.  Next time, I will try the bbq place instead.  \n\nBTW, if you are staying at the Red Rock.  There's a great Whole Foods down the street that has a lot of prepared food.  You can pick up really good stuff there and bring it back.  Also, across the street was an Italian pizza/deli that was good too.",234172
1,"Was recommended by the concierge at our hotel. Went on a Fri. nite around 6:45pm. Drove up and parking lot was dead, not a good sign. After being seated the waiter came around, it was hard to hear him over the music. When the food came it was, for the most part, disappointing. The tempura was light and not at all greasy. Sauces were pretty good but it stopped there. Those who had the sushi weren't blown away. Expectations were high as the waiter informed us that Roka Amor was voted best sushi restaurant in the country?! One person ordered the waygu beef and it was way too fatty. The pork belly appetizer, again way too fatty. The chicken teriyaki, I have had better. On the whole, the atmosphere and food were underwhelming. I'm confused by the rave reviews. May have been an off night for the restaurant but won't know as don't plan on going back. Expensive.",295400

Had snacks to eat and since it was happy hour had a couple glasses of red wine. Still got my free internet so I could wrap up business and not be days behind when I got back home. Waiter very polite, kept my water glass full, and brought me food and wine in a timely manner. Great way to end my business trip.\n\nSituation at the bar - couple had a loud and rambunctious child.

3,"I've stayed here twice but the last time I stayed was a couple of weeks ago as part of my honeymoon. The check-in line was long and kinda dragged, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Everything else was great. \n\nThe lady checking us in upgraded our room for free since we mentioned we were on our honeymoon. We got a spa room, which is just a room with a hot tub in it. I LOVED the view from the room! We were on the 33rd floor with a great view of the strip. The bed was comfortable, the hot tub was great and I loved the fact that there weren't a lot of rooms on our floor. We didn't hear much activity up there and felt like we had the whole floor to ourselves. \n\nWe ate at a few different places while we were there. We knew to stay away from America since a lot of people got sick there, according to a few reviews. I tried the buffalo wings and fries from the Sportsbar restaurant (I can't recall the name). The wings were ok but instead of dipping the wings in the buffalo sauce, they cooked them in it so they came out a bit dry. Still pretty good if you dip them in ranch. The fries were really good! We had one order of the regular fries and one order of the parmesan fries. Get the regular fries. My husband got the sliders. They were ok. \n\nWe then tried a place that was famous for it's burgers. I can't recall the name of this place either but you can't miss it since it's around the same area as the Sportsbar place and they literally have all kinds of burgers. It's their thing. I really liked that place. The burgers were good!! The service there was awesome. The waiter we got was very attentive and made sure we always had our glasses full. \n\nAs for the gambling, I don't gamble much but I did play a few of the slots. They were ok. \n\nOverall, I would stay here just because the rooms are comfy and I always get a room with a nice view.",160864
3,"For LV this is a 4 star joint, as for the midwest, east coast, and south this is a 3 1/2 star. To become a 4 star elswhere I need a little more flavor and moist ribs. As a previous reviewer stated the pork ribs were a little dry. great beans, warning to light hearted these are spicy with a touch of jalapena, beef rib is moist tender and meaty. Ribs have just the right amount of mesq/hick smoke. Rib portions are proper, can stand alone w/o sauce, and well priced (avg $2.00 per bone). Not a fan of the potato salad to much mayo, not enough sugar and mustard. Bacon added to the potato salad is alright. If the ribs were taken off the grill 10mins earlier and just a little extra rub added before and after cooking, I would rate 5 stars LV and everwhere else. This place is a gem, lets see what happens.",538145

0,"Until the owners get the quality of the pizza back up to where it once was I decided to try one of their pasta dishes and ordered the lasagna last week. At $11.75 I expected better.\n\nAccording to the menu it's served with bread, butter, and salad. The lasagna itself was uneventful and dry with no where near enough sauce. Basically it appeared as unseasoned plain browned hamburger meat and some cheese wrapped like a burrito with the pasta, sauce, some more cheese, and baked in a foil bowl no where near long enough to even heat it thoroughly and melt the cheeses. \n\nThe bread appeared to be a sub roll, not toasted garlic bread like most Italian restaurants would serve. And they forgot the butter, which definitely would have helped get that dry bread down!\n\nThe salad consisted of a small container of prepackaged lettuce, shreaded cheese and black olives. And not the freshest I've encountered. And don't expect home made ranch dressing, again, prepackaged. Maybe I'll try another pasta dish in the future to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the spaghetti is better. \n\nSo this week I decided to try the hot wings. How hard can it be to screw up buffalo wings? Apparently it's pretty easy! The wing sauce was served on the side, which I liked, but whomever was manning the fryer left them in WAY too long and burnt them to a crisp! YUCK! I guess burnt chicken is better than raw chicken. And again, prepackaged ranch dressing. (Hint hint - Hidden Valley Ranch mix is available in a restaurant size. Just add butter milk and mayo and you're good to go!)\n\nI really wish these folks would get their quality control issues addressed. You can't cut corners in the restaurant business and expect to survive on your reputation alone. And that's the ONLY reason I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt.",328638

You can always buy a burrito and a taco supreme then put them together and make your own jumbo size burrito supreme. Yeah, that's a J Monday special.....haha! \nLocation wise - it's very convenient. Pretty quick drive through. Can't say that my order has been messed up yet which is a plus for this food chain. Inside is a bit aged, doesn't have that awesome clean feel to it but it's not dirty either. Overall, when I'm in need for pretend Mexican food that's fast and fast, and I just happen to be in the area this will be my jam.",51104

1,"every time someone recommends the place, I cringe, unfortunately in the area, it's about the easiest place to dine, that being said their pizza (the only thing on the menu) is terrible, i truly prefer the crap thy used to serve us in middle school.\n\nMy tip, drink a lot before going so that you don't care about the state of the food",343716
3,"I have no idea what this place is like at night, or during the weekday lunch rush, but for lunch on a Saturday...it's perfect.  Not very busy, so its easy to get a spot at the small bar, or about any table you would want.  I prefer to sit at the bar during the day.  It's also the best way to get to know a new spot.\n\nTacos are great, but the pernil asada tacos are excellent.  Chips and salsa are fresh and the salsa has a nice kick.\n\nHighly reccomend the jalepeno infused margarita.  Amazing how many truly awful margaritas are available in the valley, but they do them very well here.\n\nPrices are more than reasonable and the happy hour prices are great.\n\nHopefully this place can be the start of bringing back The Esplanade.",485401

The cool playing with his noodles is great animation. \nBUT when it comes to the food, it's not the same story maybe it was too \""Chinese food\"" for us. \nHubby took roasted duck, but there was not much meat but lots of bones to chew on. \nDaughter took a slightly spicy (they say) beef with hand pull noodles that burned her mouth. \nI was luck with the safe chicken and mushrooms and hand pull noodles. \n\nBasically, we will not come back never ever! \n\nTake pictures, but go eat somewhere else.",369398
2,"I go by this place almost every week. Tonight was my first time stepping inside.\n\nThe layout confused me at first, I wanted to walk straight ahead after entering the doors. Then my friend waived me over to the left side where the menu was on the wall. The counter where you order is near that.\n\nI like the simplicity of the menu. Either pick a burger that they've created or make up your own burger with different options/toppings. What I did not really like was that the server at the counter did not know what \""gluten-free\"" meant. He had a very \""wtf??\"" look on him. He went in the back to talk with the cook, then came back and brought out the employee handbook. We then flipped through it to find their allergen section. \n\nHere's what I can remember from the handbook:\n* Angus burgers are okay when ordered without the bun and without \""fried toppings\"" like the haystack onions\n* You might have issues with cross-contamination as everything is cooked on the same grill\n* Fries are not okay and there's obvious cross-contamination in the fryer\n* Premium and malt milkshakes are not okay (obvious reasons)\n\nWe were in a dangerous mood, so we stayed and ordered. My gluten-free friend ordered a Sin City burger, sans onions, sans bun. I got the \""Rebel Special\"" all-American burger, sans bun. I also added an egg on top.\n\nThe burgers came out on a plate. I was expecting it to be wrapped in lettuce, so it would be more burger-like, but it was like an open-faced sandwich -- or rather, a hamburger steak with toppings. We were given forks and knives to eat it with. Should have taken a pic, but we were starving.\n\nMy \""burger\"" was decent. It had cheese, pickles, raw red onions, and some ketchup/mustard. The egg went really well with the burger. My only gripe was that the burger meat itself was a tad over-seasoned. Not sure how my friend's burger was, but he scarfed it down quick.\n\nThe cost for all this was about $20 (including drinks and a regular shake). Worth it? I don't know. But it was nice to have a \""gourmet\"" burger for once.",490529

The host said they always put the two sauces in there.  We got home and there was only the red sauce.  I called them and I told the host that the hubby was not happy....she laughs.... This was the SECOND time!  and to have a the host laugh at the situation did not help.  \nI had the mussels in the garlic white wine sauce which was tasty and plentiful.  I also ordered the hearty house salad.\nThe low rating was due to the host laughing at us.... what was that all about???,612679
0,"The vast chasm between the 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews of this place is very interesting... but my one and only experience with this place is ZERO stars. \nI ordered sushi for delivery, and it arrived quickly, but the order was made incorrectly-- didn't even come close to matching the menu description. No avocado, no green onion, AND no cucumber in the roll, and the wrong sauce. This was an expensive fancy roll with only 2 of the 5 listed things inside and a massive amount of rice to make it look big. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know, and the \""owner\"" (she insisted she was the owner) spent 11 minutes telling me \""that's just how we make it now\"" ... I explained that the roll was far from matching the menu description, didn't contain the full value of ingredients I had paid for, and that this situation needed to be fixed. She literally just kept saying \""that's how we make it now\"" and for a while tried the tactic of telling me that there WAS avocado on it, I just couldn't see it bc it was such a small slice.... yeah... there was not avocado anywhere in or on the roll. I repeatedly asked to speak to a manager or supervisor but she said she was the owner. So then I asked for her name and she straight-up refused to give me her name, numerous times. I finally realized I was arguing with an actual insane person, so I gave up. If you're ever thinking of ordering from here, just throw $15 into the trash instead.",284016

We ordered:\n\n- Caesar salad with parmesan lavash, truffle and anchovy.   The truffle and pieces set this apart from an ordinary Caesar.\n- Ahi tuna tacos with ponzu chantilly, Serrano, and avocado cream.  Three small tacos that were so delicious.  Could have eaten a couple more on my own.  \n- \""in  the shower\"" mac n cheese, lobster and brunoise vegetable.  Delicious with good amount of lobster mixed in.\n- Black angus sliders, with caramelized onions, bacon and frites.  Two juicy sliders that were very juicy and tasty.\n- Guinness braised short ribs with rainbow carrots, pommee puree and coffee foam.  This had great flavors with the Guinness and coffee foam.  The ribs were a tad dry.  \n- Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9 with orange cr\u00e8me anglaise and orange-cardamom ice cream.  Wow, this was one amazing dessert.  It was delicious down to the last drop.  Had me licking my spoon.\n\nService was excellent.  We were talking about the wine cellar with our waiter and he even took us on a tour of the cellar after our meal.

I ordered exactly what she recommended as their best - the tagliatelle and the hake.  The tagliatelle was very good, but anything would be that good drowned in a stick of butter - I'd give it a 4 out of 5 though on taste.  Then, the hake.  I can 100% tell you that this was the worst fish I have ever ever ever had.  It was completely tasteless and they paired it with really subtle vegetables like fennel.  Sooo unbelievably unimpressed.  Dessert was delicious - 5 out of 5.   After all was said and done, our two course meal + dessert took 3.5 hours!!  This restaurant serious needs to buff up its service and fix that hake.",455921

She informed me that the person who groomed my dog on Saturday is no longer with the company and she asked if I would be willing to give The Dog Wash another chance. I was hesitant, but because of her sincere and helpful customer service I decided to give it one more shot. \nI won't give it a 5 star rating just yet, I still have to say what Milo's hair will look like, but it is a step in the right direction.",455664

But it is not worth any kind of drive. There are a hundred Mexican joints in the valley as good or better. I had the flauta special. Nothing special there. Three run of the mill flautas, a quarter cup of beans and a quarter cup of rice. The beans were ok the rice was not worth putting in your mouth. Plus you get to eat off of styrofoam to go boxes. The bean and cheese burro was run of the mill fast food Mexican. The only good thing I can say is the tortillas were above average. We bought a dozen to take home.",28563
1,"First of all, like everyone else, I've wanted to try this place. I've heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. \n\nI arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), \""We don't seat parties if they aren't all here, but you can check if they're in there.\"" Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. \n\nFirst of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer's platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there's a difference between good and thinking something's good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. \n\nSecond, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I've had better service when Binion's Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. \n\nThird, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you're practically sitting on their neighbor's lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don't get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. \n\nFourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she \""LOST\"" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would've picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I'm not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn't be that rude to anyone! \n\nI give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it's worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We'll see...\n\nSo Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to  pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn't  running around forgetting people's orders, losing people's credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer's platters can pay a waiter's 4 hour shift and they'd provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!",427128
3,"A must try just for the atmosphere! My husband and I, I would say, have just aged-out of the target demographic of this place. We actually brought our baby (as I said, just aged-out, so new baby must come along on vacations) and it was super chill. While there was no sitting inside, the outside was a lovely Phoenix evening with a lovely crowd of folks. \n\nWe tried out pastries and coffee drinks. The pastries--Red Velvet Cake and Lemon Bar--I wanted to love because they came on adorable mismatching china, but at that late hour they had unfortunately staled. \n\nBut the coffee! I had a decaf Americano and it was maybe the best coffee I've ever had. And to be honest, decaf is never good. It's just something to sip on whole others have a cocktail. This decaf, though...\n\nMy husband waited in the epic cocktail line (separate from the food/coffee drink line) and asked the bartender to surprise him with something coffee-based. He was served some kind of masterpiece of spirits and freshly-pulled espresso, complete with thoughtful aromatic garnishes. Again, rocking coffee.",152187

The crudito was not pickled long enough and also bland.  We also had the corn tamales with crema and frijole.  One tamale was fried and the other was boiled.  I've never had them fried before; my husband prefers it this way.  I prefer it boiled since it's creamier.  Service was indifferent but quick.  Prices were cheap.

1,"Upon my recent stay, I was disappointed that the night manager upon check-in did not honor my marquis suite upgrade for a discounted rate when booked months prior to my stay. He charged me the full amount for a room upgrade and reasoning was because the hotel had less then 10 rooms available the day of check-in despite all the marquis suite's being unbooked. When I spoke to the day manager the next day, he pretty much hinted that the hotel didn't want to honor their room upgrade and wanted more money. Why offer a discounted upgrade in the first place. This honestly was my favorite hotel in Vegas. This is no longer the case.",276174
2,"Lowes Motor Speedway can be fun, for an hour or two.  These races are so long though.  I got a few free tickets from my boss for the Sprint Race and I went with a friend of mine from work.  The nice thing about racing is that you can bring your own brews inside, whereas most sporting events make you pay about seven dollars a beer.  This is good and bad, it saves quite a bit of money, but there are so many wasted rednecks.  Luckily they have cops on ever corner, or this place would be pure anarchy.  I actually left a kind of early, I can't really watch cars go around and around for that long.  It just isn't my thing.",348631

2,"If you love fried chicken & chicken wings, you'll enjoy this place! I decided to check this place out when I had a craving for some chicken wings and honestly BWW just doesn't do it for me. Ironically, this location was across the street from BWW so thought eh what the heck, I'll try it. \n\nOnce we arrived it was dead! However, that didn't discourage me from trying this place. Looking at the menu, the AYCE is the best deal. At first, I was a little confused on how the process worked since the hostess/cashier/waitress really didn't explain it. But in the end I was ok with it. After an hour, then service picked up.\n\nSo enough with the fluff, let's get down to business. These little suckers are huge! Seriously the first basket with 10 pieces will get you full. Make sure to split the order with 2 flavors so you can sample at least 2 different sauces. After the first basket, each basket comes with 5. And nothing says awesome like $1 PBR to wash down the wings. For a minute there, I felt like I was a competitive eater as I raced to beat the 12-yr old kid that kept eating wings. Unfortunately I paid for it after 30 some wings.\n\nWe seriously tried every flavor - sesame soy started off good but by the 3 wing, I need something to drink. It became salty and the sauce was thick. The Garlic Parm wasn't bad but honestly just tasted like fried chicken. I love sweet chili but they didn't put enough sauce on these suckers. Remember folks, if chicken is battered and deep fried, more sauce is needed than usual especially when the sauce is thin. The hot sauces were pretty similiar to Hooters. Overall, if you're a fan of Hooters, you'll enjoy this place. It's quieter, $1 beers and big screens to keep you entertained. Plus as Stephanie mentioned freshly brewed tea!",501027

She said it they used to care about their customers. \n\nManagement knew you by name, issues were resolved, and the grounds were well kept. \n\nWe have been here since Mid May 2012 and have had nothing but issues with the staff, and requests for repairs. The Repair staff is phenominal. The process to get the simplest request done takes 2-3 times as long usually due to management dropping the ball.\n\nWe made a payment on time through their system and it not only posted late we got to pay an additional 100 bucks in fees, which the office would not bother crediting even though it was their error. There bill pay switched over and after speaking directly with their systems operator/company they verified it was their error. But we were still out an extra 100. \n\nWe were up front with them about two pets moving in. We told them we would not renew if our pets weren't allowed. We were told by management everything was fine. Two months into the lease and only after we were attacked by a neighbors dog, my hand and my smaller dogs face, resolved, not on the leash and not even listed on the property, we received a notice of unauthorized dogs on the property. After confronting the office it turns out they messed up but we now get to pay an additional 51 a month. Even though according to our agreement that cost is already factored in... \n\nNeedless to say after numerous headaches with the office staff having very poor customer service, after ripping us off, we are now seeking legal action to garner back our costs spent and have also contacted The Better Business Bureau. \n\nI would not recommend this property to anyone. The cabinets are cheap, the appliances in the kitchen were new, the dryer and washer were old. Stains on carpet when we moved in and after requesting a price to replace we were quoted over 900 dollars out of pocket to replace carpet we were renting. \n\nThe grounds are well kept, and the community is really sketchy, I have seen a man pummel a women and after I threatened him to lay off her he just flat out said \""I don't care, seems to be the slogan of the Broadstone Ahwatukee Fairways.

4,"We bought an Amazon voucher for $99 that gave us 1/4 of a truck (supposedly a $247 value). We had a large pile of bricks, old cement blocks, tree limbs, bags of shingles, sticks, and other random yard refuse. We called and they quickly got us an appointment for the next day. They (Matt & Chris) showed up exactly on time and reviewed our pile and said they could take care of it for an additional $100 on top of our voucher. This was fine with us, as for $199 total cost they would do the hauling and loading of all that for us whereas our other only option was to get a dumpster for about $240 and do it ourselves. Anyhow, they were very friendly and got to work, constantly providing updates. Unfortunately, as they moved down the pile they ran into a bee nest, and one of them was allergic. However, they very kindly proceeded forward and just avoided the main bee area (note to others, inspect and SPRAY before these guys arrive). Anyhow, our load definitely took much more than 1/4 of the truck and they felt they had underestimated a little and didn't realize the number of bricks on the bottom of the pile, so we both agreed to up the final price to $150 additional on top of the voucher. So, this ended up being about the same cost to us, but we didn't do any of the work. Gave them each $10 for their help and hard work, and our yard is almost back to looking good (except the little pile still remaining for us to do Bee Battle with).\n\nOverall, these are good folks and provide you an estimate up front, so we were pleased.",566619

After spending a lot of dough on an amazing meal at STK the night before we decided on a more casual less expensive (or so we thought!) one. Todd English has gotten a lot of buzz on Top Chef so why not? Well this is why not: the food was ridiculously overpriced, carelessly made and couldn't hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost. My $20 plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back, when it came back the flavor wasn't even up to Costco's high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce. I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was $87 before the tip!! $20 for one beer flight of four tiny tastes? Really?

I've shopped at Best Buy before... not for any major purchases, usually just for CDs or DVDs, never had any problems until now.\n\nI decided to buy a computer from them. Biggest waste of time/money. First of all, their \""computer experts\"" couldn't tell me anything about the computers that wasn't written on the little spec cards on the displays. But i had done my own research, so i thought I was making a good choice. I also bought it \""optimized\"" which is where for $39.99 they have Geek Squad go through and get rid of the programs that you dont need and do all of the updates. \n\nI got home, and right off the bat had problems with the computer. It was shutting off randomly, wasn't downloading programs correctly... pretty much just a bad product. I returned it today, which brings me to...\n\nTheir HORRENDOUS customer service. They checked over the computer and did declare that it was defective. Then they told me that they would refund my money... minus the $39.99 for the optimization, because \""labor charges are non-refundable\"". Well that's great, except for the fact that they sold me a DEFECTIVE product, AFTER I paid them extra to make sure that it wasn't defective! But they really had a hard time understanding that. I had to talk to a salesgirl and two managers, one who had to call a higher up. For $40. come on people. I think I fought with them for a half an hour. They were ridiculously rude, and really had nothing to say except \""it's our policy not to refund labor charges\"". Long story short, I eventually was reimbursed the full amount and was rid of the POS computer. \n\nLast time I EVER shop at ANY Best Buy",315055
2,"I love thai rama for the most part their panang curry and evil jungle noodles are always on point.  But service at this location was not on point, yeah the girl was nice but majority of the time she was on the phone with god knows who.  She rarely came over to see how our food was or if we wanted more to drink given the fact that our food's spice level was a lot hotter than what we asked for.  My friend ordered the paht thai( for some reason is always dry regardless of location)  and myself the panang curry as usual.  My friend had asked for no spices in hers and it came out hotter than my medium panang.  The girl apparently misunderstood our orders obviously since she had nothing to write down our orders on. She said after getting off the phone that it was her mistake even though apparently the chefs have been off  as far as getting the spice levels on point.  \n\nShe came back after a few minutes and said \""the cook that made your dish was...MEXICAN\"" my friend and I could not believe this white girl said that (we are half filipino) to us like that would make a difference. The way she said it was just bizzare to us. If I were part mexican I would have been pissed. It shouldn't matter what someone's race is on who is making the food.  The service was poor here our food came out spicier than called for and the egg rolls seemed lightweight stale.  Not a great way to start our day.",372817
2,"Spent four days at Wynn and was a regular in the book.  the Reserved Seating (for NFL and College Football) is monitored by Sharon and are for guests of the hotel only.  I liked this nice touch.   Did not care for the $300 bet requirement to get libations when, as Mary Ann C points out, Bellagio is completely free (and they put the games on the big TV's)  Still, if you are staying at Wynn, worth checking out.",381653
2,"Stayed 4 nights for business. Overall the hotel was ok. Front desk staff indicated our room was a \""suite\"" with two double beds, despite requesting a king.The room was clean, but small things like chipped lamps, missing paint, small hole in the drapes and an unsuccessful attempt to cover a mark on the wall was disappointing. The AC would make a big \""clank\"" when it cycled on. \n\nStaff is very, very friendly, pool was nice and the location is great-across from a ton of restaurants. The beds were comfortable. Unfortunately the rest of the room wasn't much to call home about.",6723
2,"Honestly I wasn't impressed. I've been to fantastic sushi restaurants including Nobu in NYC, so maybe I have high standards, but the way I like sushi is when you actually can be impressed by the quality of the fish. Unfortunately, the specialty rolls that Cyros offers seems to cover up the taste of the fish. Their most popular roll, the Cyros Avante Garde, had fried shallots and garlic on top...way too much garlic flavor for sushi. I will say the service is friendly and they have a good selection of sake. Other than that, the atmosphere is not so great...head to Roosters next door for a better atmosphere. Otherwise if you're looking for sushi that actually tastes like sushi, head over to Yama or Ru San's.",426035
4,"If you want authentic Greek food, this place is where to go. Servings are huge, and the flavors are amazing. Not to mention a great staff. The garlic Feta fries are to die for. I always order the Lamb gyro plate. The salad is always fresh, the dressing not too tangy. Their rice alone is so good I could eat it by itself. The tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've ever tasted. This place continues to deliver quality food each time and never disappoints.",439190
2,"I've been to Vegas enough times to be bored with the basics (drink, gamble, try to pick up some girl out of my league), so I was excited to hear of different things to do in town.\n\nWith our group of 7, I'd hoped we'd play some private games, but this place has larger games than what i'm used to. You probably need to pay a lot of money to get some private games.\n\nThe melee style game got old real quick. I'm a bigger fan of the team game which is similar to capture the flag. The attendant there said that they only play team games during the overnight kid parties.\n\nI have no interest in having a slumber party with a bunch 12 year olds just so I can play my favorite style of laser tag, that's just me.\n\nThe suits are alright, the course is compact but with lots of hidey places and mirrors to bounce off of, but like I said, the game just gets boring If you're just running around shooting.\n\nScrew the stupid tweens who walk behind you and keep shooting you after your suit gets active again.\n\nTranq darts might be a good thing to use - it's dark inside and no one'll see you knock the annoying kid out.",70504
2,"Coffee and Wine Bar? Yes please and thank you! I came in for a simple coffee and bagel one morning and found loads of seating, a refreshingly unpretentious coffee shop with interesting fliers and of course, a wine bar. If only AM wine drinking were socially acceptable...\n\nPrices were comparable to any other coffee place and there are multiple rooms to lounge in. While I was sipping away my cousin told me they are a new location for local produce pick up which is really neat, and their wine tasting class schedule makes me wish I lived closer. Apparently all the cool kids go here - just one more reason to see and be scene at the CCCC.",223339
2,"We like this place better than the rest of the chain, boring, mediocre Mexican food joints such as El Torito, Macayo's, Manuel's, Gardunos, or Garcias. The portions are generous, the food seems fresher and more colorful than these other \""Americanised\"" Mexican places. Good service too. The chicken quesadilla is great, and their nachos are served as individual chips piled with meat and cheese on them, sort of unique. Like I said, this is the best of the chains, but its not authentic Mexican food at all!",324537
4,"Words cannot describe this show. Garth is amazing. His last tour ended in 1998 and since then he has stayed at home in Oklahoma raising his children. When his tour ended I was a little too young to be going to concerts. \nI had always said that there were only two reasons I'd ever go to Las Vegas. One was to see David Copperfield and the second was to see Garth Brooks if he ever came. Well, I saw David a couple years ago when he came to San Jose and last October I learned that Garth would be playing at Wynn. \nThe tickets are VERY hard to get. The first series of dates sold out in 5 hours. I was, unfortunately, not one of the lucky ones that got tickets that day. I did manage to get tickets earlier this month and planned the trip around my mom's birthday. \nIt was just Garth and his guitar up on stage. In this particular show that I went to he started out talking about what influenced him growing up and who his father and brothers were listening to. He started taking requests and even brought out his wife- Trisha Yearwood- to sing a couple songs! \nHe is a very amazing and talented artist and that showed on stage once again.",426712

The Barros in Maricopa is 10x more comfortable. \n\nThe quality of the pizza was sub par. All the pizzas were slightly burned and covered in grease. Lastly there were flies buzzing about. When my friend pointed it out to the waitress she seemed very smug as she asked him, \""what should we do about it?\"" Put up some fly paper, clean the place out. Very unprofessional.

We were OK with that because we had time. So you are in a hurry don't go . We get our food we were not impress at all. I had the chili rellano dinner , they cover it with some red sauce it taste like ketchup. The guacamole had no favor at all. After spending $100 for 3 meals, 6 beers, and one appetizer we just where not impress at all. On our way out we hear a great band, now they do have a great band .

3,Worth it just for the view.\n\nWe only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)\n\nThe drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there. But the main thing we went for (the view) was well worth it - especially at night looking right across the light beam coming from the pyramid below.,264892
3,"This review is based on happy hour and appetizers. \n\nI had never been to Lolita's before, but was there because of a Rock 'n Roll wine tasting event. After sampling the wine, my friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat. We entered the main dining area and were immediately seated. Our server, Aidin, approached us and recommended that we try their happy hour menu since we still had 30 minutes left. \n\nWhile we waited on our order we got chips, bean dip and salsa. I thought the salsa was ok, but the black bean dip and chips were great. We ended up ordering the Mini Tacos and Dynamite Beef Taquitos. The tacos were truly \""mini\"" but delicious! And we ordered a second plate. The taquitos were also really good and came with a few dipping sauces. \n\nHonestly, I am a little surprised to see how low the ratings are for Lolita's (I didn't look at them before I went.) Our waiter was great, the service was fast, and the atmosphere was fun. Overall the food was great and the happy hour pricing made it worthwhile.",469600
0,I've come here often and always had good food and service. Except for today. My order was wrong. No big deal I walk up they offer to fix it I say ok. 15 minutes later no food. I walk up again and the guy asked if I had received my food. I said no so he went and had them make it again. They did. I get back to my table and the food is wrong again. Then when I walk back up the girl tells me I asked for different hotdogs. I asked for what I ordered and what was on my receipt. No one apologized. I got frustrated and walked to the cashier and asked for my money back. I said I'd pay for the burger and fries my girlfriend ate but not the hotdogs. \n\nWhat made me mad was no manager took responsibility or tried to make it right. All I got was grief from the employees for their mistakes. Sad to say but I'll never go back.,590913
1,"My family got treatments here this weekend and it was a lovely spa. The check in staff was nice enough but we were informed upon checking in that tips were already included on our bills and we couldn't remove them. This kind of turned us off and we inquired about canceling our appointments... they have a 2 day cancellation policy which I think is excessive. So basically we were forced to tip our technicians the amount that MGM wanted them to be tipped, which I didn't think was all that awesome.\n\nThe spa is split into a men's and women's spa but all of the treatment rooms are shared - private, but shared between the two spas. They're well appointed with steam rooms and a large jacuzzi for each one. My dad got a deep tissue and said it was absolutely fantastic. My sister and I got manicures that were good but not worth the $160. We got them on Saturday and it's Tuesday and my polish has almost entirely chipped off! My tech used Seche Vite for the top coat so I know it wasn't that, but she had the balls to dilute the polish she was using on my nails with acetone in front of me... something that makes polish chip. For $160 mani/pedis I thought that was a really crummy way to handle your materials. My technician was sweet though and the actual manicure and pedicure were good. Just bring your own polish and know it's going to be overpriced. Overall I've had better for the steep price but I'd probably go back.",185198

1,"Meh.  It's okay if you like your pizza crust soggy.  I've been several times before and the crust has always been soggy.  On my most recent visit I asked them to bake the crust longer to make it crispy.  It was soggy again.  \n\nPlease note one point of caution regarding the other reviews of this restaurant.  This place may be quicker to get into, but it is most definitely NOT anywhere near the caliber of Pizzeria Bianco.  Would every pizza chef in town who has a James Beard Award please raise their hand?\n\nOn March 18th I received this message from Karen Martingilio:\n \nDear Ted, thanks for giving us a couple of tries, everyone has their opinion about what they like in a pizza, in Italy they use a knife and fork, we make our crust more soft and chewy more Italian style, and that does not appeal to everyone, however to imply that our other reviewers are just coming to us because the wait is shorter, or that we take less pride in our product then others is somewhat mean spirited, I m sure you didn t intend to insult our dedicated chef or our restaurant but unfortunately it could be misinterpeted by other Yelpers, you are intitled to your opinion and so are our fans on Yelp, thanks again for your imput, Karen Martingilio\n\nYelpers, as Karen notes above, I am entitled to my opinion.

1,Don't believe that hype - its a sequel... Went there on a Saturday night got confused with Moon - went there last year with friends and loved it but is closed now :(. Great view beautiful high end decor..... However no dance floor the man walk way has DJ setup and is the dance floor with DJ setup off to the side so everyone dancing is in the way of servers trying to get drinks out to the balcony and bottle service areas and even employees that need to bring supplies to the bar have to go through the dance floor causing spilled drinks etc (Moon had a large traditional dedicated dance floor which was great) . DJ was erratic gong from hip hop the EDM to old school to God knows what. Whatever type of music you like there's a song you like you go to the dance floor (walkway where people are dancing) then next track will be something totally different and kill the vibe (Moon had more consistent DJs). Balcony is tiny (compared to Moon which has an awesome balcony). Drinks were pricey $16 for bottom shelf well drinks. Very little seating other than bottle service areas. Like alot of the clubs in the last several years this club only makes sense to me if you a planning to go VIP and get bottle service and socialize. I you have to dance I would go to a place with dance floor and hip hop or EDM DJ etc depending on your tastes and preferences. We should have went to 1 Oak from what I hear. I miss Moon please bring Moon back that was 5 Stars for me.,181573
1,"This place was a Mega Cafe, a Coco's and Mi Tierra, prior to becoming Fiesta Chips and Salsa.\n\nI don't think they will be around long, Mi Tierra had much better food, at much more reasonable prices. Mi Tierra charged $7.50, including taxes, for a beef chimichanga, sides of rice and beans, with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo on the side, with iced tea. Chips and Salsa charged $12.00, including taxes, for a burrito with a little shedded lettuce and a small slice of tomato on the side, with iced tea. As I said, if Mi Tierra, selling better food at lower prices, went out of business, I don't thinks Chips and Salsa stands a chance,\n\nThat being said on with the Yelp:\n\nThey start you off with chips and salsa, no surprise there. However, you would think with the name Chips and Salsa, they would have good chips and salsa, they don't. The chips were cooked wrong, they were cooked at too low a temperature for too long. The result was over cooked, on the edge of burnt, oily chips. The chips were so oily, they were shiny, as if someone poured oil over them. The salsa was okay, nothing to write home about. With salsa in their name, you might think they would have brought a variety of salsas for the chips, (Mi Tierra brought two kinds of salsa and bean dip to go with the chips, while you were deciding on what to order and while they prepared it.).\n\nI had a Grande Meat Burrito (carne asada), it was okay,  Carne asada, rice, cheese, beans and pico de gallo, in a flour tortilla, though I didn't notice any cheese. It was not served with any sauces, I would think a place with salsa in it's name would want to showcase their salsas, guess not. Although size is relative, the grande burrito was closer to medio, than grande.\n\nWhile there I heard several complaints from people, on the lines of \"" there's suppose to be guacamole served with this\"" or \"" I specifically ordered this with the sauce on the side, they put the sauce on it and tried to scrape it off'\"". So apparently the kitchen doesn't know what's on their menu or how it's served and have trouble with simple requests. I assume the servers corrected the mistakes, but it's always more impressive to get it right in the first place. As near as I can tell, I got what I ordered, so it appears I was lucky. The server checked to see if I needed anything else, refilled my tea, etc. so I have no problem with the service side. I gave an extra star for the server, a girl with dark red hair, or they would have gotten a one star.\n\nThere are too many good Mexican restaurants in town, to settle for what they offer at this one. I won't be back.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAngie M.commented, \""hey wen did u went to fiseta and chips salsa and wht time   u should talked to the main manger \"" [sic]\n\nIn my response to Angie, I took the time to translate into English, corrected the spelling of fiesta, corrected the business name and answered her questions.\n\nQue lastima (what a shame), this may account for the mistakes people were having with their orders.",639622

I work about a block away, so it's a great place to grab a bite, and they usually can get you in and out of there in an hour.  So far I have tried the black bean veggie burger and the Caprese sandwich, both are delicious! They have wedge and sweet potato fries which makes it really hard to choose, but after trying both I prefer the wedge fries which is surprising for me, but they're really that good!  Yesterday the table next to me ordered the mac n cheese, it looked fantastic! I'll be giving that a try soon.  The girls and I decided to splurge at lunch yesterday and ordered the red velvet cake.  I'm not a huge cake fan, but this was very moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. Another quick tip for switch... they take reservations, even for lunch!",279401
3,"We were given an exception when I booked a reservation for 5 on a Friday evening - normally they only take 6 or more. I asked for a red blend and was offering a fantastic Italian Cab Sauv/Sangiovese for a reasonable $6/glass. \nThe place looks clean but I did see a fruit fly or two around my meal and table. \nService was very fast (so fast my friend \""complained\"" her food was TOO hot!) and attentive. \nI had the zuppi de pesce. I asked for no squid but it was still on my plate. Normally most place cannot cook squid well and it was confirmed here. Sliced with skin and rubbery with a too salty flavor that tells me not only was it old but overcooked. However the sauce was very tasty, pasta was al dente n the rest of the seafood cooked well - although the mussels were a little briny. \nI also got to try a chicken dish with an amazing white cream sauce prosciutto and I think peas.

I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but for what we can get around here, I was satisfied. \n\nI'll just mention the things we got during the dine in since it was more recent and I remember it better... ;)\n\nThe cold appetizers - tofu, white - not spicy, greenish (not sure if that was tofu, but hey, I don't really mind. If it tastes good I'll try it!)  - little spicy, pig ear - spicy. All were delish!\n\nThere's a hot oil & spicy fish dish. They're known for it. That was super good! We did ask for it not to be as spicy and they accommodated us, which was nice. It was just enough kick for us. TRY THAT! She also recommended the equivalent dish, but with lamb. Next time I'd like to taste test that one. \n\nThe fried pork ribs were just normal. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. We also got a veggie dish. We always ask what kind of veggies they have. Sometimes they have ones that aren't on the menu. \n\nAll this filled the 6 of us and was pretty reasonable in price. \n\nI liked the service. I mean really, I never go to a Chinese restaurant expecting good service. I just look forward to the food. But the lady gave us her recommendations. We were hesitant on the fish dish (bc we weren't sure if it'd be too spicy), and she told us to get the lunch portion vs the dinner since it was smaller and if we didn't like it, we wouldn't have as much. That was cool. \n\nIf you like spicy, I'm sure this place would fill your tank. If you aren't total spicy fans, there's still enough stuff and ways for them to accommodate to your liking, like they did for us.",530716

4,"I'm surprised to see this place with such a low rating. Today was my first experience at Gallo's and, after reading the reviews here, I'm hoping that experience was not a fluke. Our oldest two sons had a birthday party to attend. We decided to take our youngest out for an early dinner. We arrived shortly after 4 and the place had a few patrons but was not at all busy. We seated ourselves and someone attended to us right away. The service was outstanding; very friendly staff. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing. The food? Excellent! Salads came with our meals and were brought out first. They were nothing exciting, just simple salads but I usually don't expect much with a salad. As long as it isn't brown I'm happy. We ordered garlic bread and it was perfect; crispy but soft. The marinara sauce was delicous. We also ordered the stuffed hot peppers which were awesome. I had the baked ziti and my husband had the lasagna. Both were delicious. We both commented on the fact that Gallo's reminded us of our favorite Italian place in Japan, Angelo's. Yeah, I know...Italian food in Japan? It was great though. Our son ordered the kid's pizza and we tried that too. I prefer New York style thin crust and this has a thick crust. But it is a buttery, garlic crust that is worth eating just by itself. It was a wonderful experience and a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe are definitely going back.",147527

The front desk lady said that all the high floor rooms were taken by the convention that was in town. She said she had a room on the 8th fl. I said that wouldn't do so she found, lol, 2 rooms on the 15th floor. The room looked at the convention center roof. They have 56 floors so you know where we were. She also told me that for what I was paying that was a good room. They sent me a special room rate. Why do they send it if you shouldn't use it. The floors are dirty and the bathtub/shower is stupid. Stay at The Cosmo or Vdara.",375168
4,"This place is as good as it gets! Amazing selection, super helpful staff, and the prices on used books CAN NOT be beat. I used to shop at bookmans until I stumbled upon this place, the prices are 25-50% cheaper on used books. And if you don't find something you are looking for, the staff is always happy to help you find it or order it for you. I took a Children's Lit class a few semester back and I practically lived at this store on the weekends. They never let me down and I was always able to find what i needed, and on the flip side my son's book collection grew exponentially :)",207554

People here won't do a job! ....rush rush rush to get to the next fool to pay them 25 bucks for a pedicure. They didn't take the cuticles cleaned up, soaked my feet and put the polish on my toes which was smeared all over. It looked like a 2 year old putting lipstick for fun. Omg! Awful, the guy and the chick here had major attitude. They try to fix wrong with another wrong... The heck bro! So I had to stop it. No Polish walked out.. Still paid them 25 bucks they might need it to go back to school to be a nail tech or manicurist. Ouch! Bam!",59895

Even though i wasn't buying it, the lady working there was so nice as to grab a stool, take down the heavy airsoft gun and even open it up for me to hold it. If i can recall correctly, the airsoft gun was an AGM MP40 , all metal construction, great weight and so on, but getting off topic on what this review is for!! LOL down to it, random airsoft gun in a cutesy asian store\n\nEverytime i walk in i like to take my time and browse the aisles even if i'm not into hello kitty or sailor moon, i still walk and take a look.

1,"Such a large menu, which covers several different Asian cuisines, is always a red light to me. I really don't believe any kitchen can specialize in Tai, Chinese, Vietnamese AND Japanese cooking. Therefore I ordered sushi, fried tofu & hibachi. The sushi was really good; fresh & well-made. The hibachi was fine, a big plate of meat, rice & stir fried veggies, all fresh. \nThe fried food was inedible. My tofu was flavorless. I wanted a light, panko-battered dish served crispy and hot, sprinkled with fish flakes. I got lumps of lukewarm tofu rolled in corn meal, cooked off quickly and not even given a sprinkle of salt. My companion's fried softshell crabs were just as awful. Once again, flavorless, cold and definitely not fresh.\nI think this place could be successful if they specialized in the late night crowd--drunk and starving and looking to fill their bellies at 3 in the morning--because apart from the sushi,  Akahana is little more than an Asian Denny's.",495226
4,"So I have visited this place several times in between my first review and this review and they have managed to keep their 5 star rating. Tonight was the epitome of it all! I could not believe how delicious my meal was. I did finally try a new sauce: Kung Pao, so I don't know if that was it or not but everything was cooked to perfection. It was the busiest I have ever seen the restaurant too. \n\nThe staff, which was clearly under a lot of pressure, did not compromise their customer service at all. There was a woman helping out the chefs who was extremely courteous and would help you out with whatever you want. She kept the line moving and was very efficient. The chefs were also really nice! My mom has a food allergy. When you mention you have a food allergy they clean the entire cook top and get new utensils. Most places have an attitude because it's extra work for them. Not this place, they were very nice and were able to accommodate my mom's request. Even when she asked for the food to be cooked well done with not a lot of water, the chef said \""sure\"" and made her food to perfection. \n\nLove this place!",199227

The chicken of the chicken and waffles was delicious.  I can't go the full 5 only because I found the waffles to be a little bland.  I was a little envious of the giant pancake at the table next to us.

To make matters worse, when my husband pointed out that there was a \""fairer skinned\"" person right before us, who was let in wearing a T-shirt, the manager simply said, \""To imply that I am a racist is ridiculous.\"" He then told us to leave and later threatened to call the police.

They took me back through the \""Bahamas' room which they said to put them in, I was very uncomfortable walking through, dogs looked dirty and were going crazy. It had the feel and appeal of a humane society. They thankfully took me through to a quieter room \""Maui\"" and put them in a kennel run, that was indoor/outdoor. I left them their dog pillow and uncomfortably left.\n  \nWhen I returned to pick them up, the lady called in back and requested them picked up from Bahama's! I hope not!  When my dogs came out they were dirty and smelled horrible. The dog pillow was filthy and stunk I almost wanted to throw it in the dumpster (I wish I had during the car ride ). When I put them in the car,  my boyfriend and I gagged automatically. We had to pull over because the smell was so bad I thought I was going to puke.  :(  I washed the dogs and the pillow cover asap, but it took some scrubbing to get the grime off. \n\nI do not know what went on but I am horrified by this.

1,"Disclaimer: I am not a resident at Paragon. I went in looking for a 1-bedroom apartment. \n\nI am on the hunt for an apartment and I took myself through north scottsdale today, stopping in at paragon on my tour. I would say that just about every apartment sales office that opens on sundays (some don't, granted) opens at 12PM and stays open to 4 or 5PM. I arrived at 12:45 to find out that Paragon doesn't open until 1PM. lame. I toyed with leaving and not seeing the property, but didn't listen to my instincts (mistake #1). I waited it out and came back at about 1:05. \n\nI walk inside and there is no one at reception, well fine, i'll just wait. Someone yells from the back \""Morning!!\"" I don't know if they are talking to me so I say nothing. \""MORNING!!!\"" again. \""oh hi there\"" I reply. \""You are just going to have to wait, I'm setting up still!\"" Huh? Who says that? I wasn't complaining about waiting, and besides that, you don't talk to clients or prospective clients that way. \n\nIris walks out and offers me a cookie as she walks by saying \""you know we don't open until 1PM\"" me: \""It is one, isn't it?\"" her: \""barely.\"" UGH! Why didn't I leave?! Then we are talking and she's getting my info and she asks my price range and then tells me \""oh well you won't find that here.\"" and yet I didn't leave (mistake #56 at this point). So for the first half of the tour and explanation she is a big puffed up elitist telling me how exclusive this is or how fancy and amazing that is.  Amazingly by the second half of the tour she was telling me she could get the price down to my price range (through flagrantly faulty math) and saying she could really picture me here. Yikes, no thanks lady!\n\nA 1-bedroom here runs $990 a month with no utilities included. The apartment and the complex are nice, but I have seen apartments that are equally as nice with the exact same amenities for $250 less per month.

I was torn between breakfast and lunch. I decided to get \""Chicken and Waffles\""  after a short wait my food arrived. I should add I did not get the pecans that were supposed to come on them.  Anywho I got the maple syrup that the waiter recommended. The waffle was light and fluffy with a nice crisp.  Nothing to write home about.  The chicken.. was extremely hard.  They were the chicken strips breaded. I honestly Felt like Chevy Chase in Christmas vacation eating that burnt turkey.  Three pieces came with it. ALL three pieces were way over cooked.  I had to say something to the waitress. Her response surprising. She said \""yea we get that a lot,  most people  soak it in maple syrup to soften it up\"" I'm like are you serious?  She continued \""it gets hard sitting under heat lamps,  when I have it I really gotta tear into it with a knife\"" hold up?  Its chicken strips a knife shouldn't be involved. I make fried chicken strips all the time and I NEVER have that problem. This place gets two stars from me based on the \""Leather\"" Chicken strips and the \""I know this and it sucks\"" tude about the chicken.",582469

The wings aren't as scrawny as most places I go to;they are actually good meaty wings.The hot garlic is probably my favorite sauce because I can't get it anywhere else.

3,"So I stayed at Encore last year for CES and the place had just opened. Didn't have a great experience. They lost my luggage the first night when I left it with the bell boy, checking out was a nightmare, ordering food and having basic things in the room (like a pen) proved too difficult... but I must say they redeemed themselves this year.\nI stayed in the tower suites this time around for CES and would highly recommend it. The suite is huge... 2 bathrooms, a massage room, living room, bedroom... way more space than I needed. The staff were very sweet, the concierge was great with reservations and checking out was very easy. The separate entrance is key if you don;t have a limo because it makes getting a cab much easier (and you avoid the ludicrous lines that exist at the main casino entrance) and check out is much faster. \nThe gym fee is a little ridiculous but that's just standard Vegas so it's not specific to Wynn/Encore.  \nLast thing -  one day the maid threw out bags that I had left in the middle of my bathroom... she thought they were trash. Except they contained the shoe bags and receipts from several pairs of beautiful new shoes I had bought. She threw them out by accident. Obviously I was pissed... but they were very professional dealing with it and went back the store and sent up 5 sets of Louboutin and Sergio Rossi covers after they realized what had happened (and who am I kidding... I wasn't going to return the things :) Throwing out the bags - not cool - but the way they dealt with it was very professional and very much appreciated. \nOverall, I like Encore more than Wynn and it is definitely one of my go to hotels when i go to Vegas.",321796

2,"Heart Attack Grill is a hamburger joint with a zany parallel universe hospital theme.  Waitresses dress in somewhat provocative nurse outfits (The type of nurse outfits you'll see in fantasy playbacks in movies with everything all boosted up and sticking out).  Following the theme, each customer is required to wear hospital gowns upon entrance.  Their burger is eloquently named the \""bypass\"" and depending on the number of patties it'll be the single, double, triple, quadruple (more if you'd like...) \""bypass\"".  \n\nWhen a place is called heart attack anything, it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question.  Parodied movie posters are plastered all over the walls.  While I'm no Jason Bourne, I always do a scan of any place I go too before settling in my seat.  Here my sights stopped on a rather large scale.  Above the scale was an indicator pronouncing whoever weighs 350 lbs, WILL EAT FREE!  First off, if you weigh that much, eating here may be hazardous to your health.  I was lucky enough to see a fellow customer climb onto that scale and \""win\"" a free meal.  Sirens went off with applause following.  \n\nA close buddy from L.A. had been talking about trying this place out on a couple occasions.  The three of us looking at menus in hospital gowns was a sight to see.  After a couple chuckles we ordered.  The smallest of the group ended up ordering the triple bypass while I chickened out and got the double.  We all shared a side of chili cheese fries which could have fed five or more easily.  Sizes are massive and while I did finish most of it; I don't think it was a particularly good idea.  Splicing chili on top of each burger patty inserted another layer of taste to a burger that consisted mainly of overly greasy meat flavor.  Take out the notion I was clogging my arteries at an exponential rate after each bite, the burger was ok.    \n\nThe novelty of it all is an experience in itself.  Seeing a couple Japanese tourists being spanked by the nurse waitresses is another interesting sight.  Rule is if you don't finish, you get spanked.  I'm assuming this was optional since any normal human would assuredly have trouble finishing these burgers and not everyone got spanked.  Aligning their extreme gimmick with the same motto of a more adult Hooter's equating to more show than emphasis on food, Heart Attack Grill is worth at least ONE visit.  I don't know about a second.  My heart may not be able to handle it.",530519

4,"Two Words: absolutely delicious.\n\nThis place is chock-full of character. It's a great escape from a horrendous workday. I've never been to France but the vibe here feels French cafe-esque. The owner, who is French, is also the cashier and he is a total charmer. Plus he is happy to help you out with your order should you have any questions. Sometimes I just ask him questions I know the answer to just to hear his accent. I know I know....\nAnd It's also a family owned\\run restaurant so that also adds some warm and fuzzies to the experience.\n\nI've been here twice (soon to be 3x because I want to go back tomorrow).\nBoth times I ordered the chipotle sandwich and both times I considered licking every crumb and drop of sauce off my plate. I could say it was the flavor combination. I could say it was due to the incredible chipotle sauce and fresh avocados. I could also say that it was the fresh & crisp baguette it came on. I'll just say it was all of the above.\n\nI ordered a cup of the cream of celery soup today. I don't even like celery all that much, but I had heard the owner\\cashier describe it to the guy in front of me and I was sold. My only regret was I didn't order a bowl.... or a gallon. There was a distinct essence of  fresh celery in the soup but somehow, maybe magically, the creaminess mixed in with the freshness made this the best cup of soup I can remember. Apparently I do like celery.\n\nBoth times I ordered a coffee beverage. For the coffee snobs out there, myself included, they serve Illy coffee. For the non-coffee snobs -- this is AWESOME coffee. First time was drip coffee the 2nd was an iced white mocha.... both yummy.\n\nSo for a half sandwich, a cup of soup, and medium iced white mocha totals just 12 bucks..... a small price to pay for perfection, I'd say. Baguette Cafe is a jewel of a lunch joint. If I didn't work in the area, I'd find an excuse to drive across town just to enjoy it.\n\nRun don't walk to this place.

Everyone was pissed, walking out, more people were coming in, I gave them a heads up that the service sucks and that you'll be waiting a long time.

2,"We went here a few months ago to celebrate my coming to Charlotte.  It is a pricey upscale casual restaurant - I think we walked out after all was said and done at well over 100 a piece, but it was worth it for the one-time experience.  The dining room was open and decorated to look like an outdoor patio of an Italian villa.  Service was excellent.  I was surprised how down home the cooking was... especially the sides - we had scalloped potatoes and green beans - both southern style.  The potatoes were out of this world, and we joked if we ever went back we would just order sides.  I had the lobster and scallops and my bf had steak - they were both good but we both said after wards that we felt like we had had better.  I don't know, I guess for the price we both expected to have our socks blown off, but that wasn't the case at least with the entrees.  I don't think I will go back because we left with that feeling.

2,"Got a great priceline price of $55 with a free breakfast (hot entree with oj and coffee)  and free shuttle from the airport til 10pm and a free happy hour with light snacks.\nNow the downside:\nThe place is old and run down, outside looks great with the 2 pools, and tennis courts but when you get in the rooms, they are old, musty and dated.  \nThere is a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and toaster oven inside the room.\nWhen I checked in late night, the staff wasn't very helpful, felt like I was bothering them.\nSince the place is so large and the doors open to the outside, doesn't feel as secure for a single female traveler.",108309
1,"We stayed at Paris in April for 7 nights.  The room and restaurants are great.  Prices are reasonable.  The housekeeping staff is wonderful, never had an issue.  On our 5th night we were dismayed that the guests in the room next to us were smoking an \""illegal substance\"" and the aroma/smoke was coming into our room.  I've never had this problem in any other hotel stay and had to complain.  We explanined that we are drug tested by our employer and it was a problem.  It was 11 pm and the only solution they had was to move us!!  We had to pack up all of our belongings and relocate.  They wouldn't ask our neighbors to cease their behavior.  When we complained the next day about the inconvience the front desk told us to fill out a comment card.  I've never been so disregarded!!!!!",161991
0,"Terrible service. Manager (Omar) was unwilling to listen at all. Our food came out cold twice but the server never came back so we finally just ate the cold food. I'm local and I can tell you there are far better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. The prices were about double what I've seen and for that I would expect someone to care. We probably saw our server three times and we had to be the annoying people who asked other servers for drinks, forks, etc. I would suggest avoiding this place.",576685
3,"There are actually things grown in the Las Vegas area available at this market, but you have to know where to look!  The California stuff is nice (citrus, strawberries and Central Valley supplements), but thanks to Gilcrease, Herbs by Diane from Boulder City and another vendor or two there is the option to buy from actual local sources.  This certainly beats any of the other Fresh 52 markets in terms of vendors and variety.\n\nThe parking was tight and I had to stalk someone for a spot.  Also, the indoor vendors are a little oddly place...why?  Not a bad idea, just unusual and strangely formatted.  Certainly a nice option for adverse weather, but that indoor venue also got crowded and congested as any setting with lots of lingering folks.\n\nI was pleased to come away with things I could never find in a commercial grocery superstore including corn shoots, a massive and beautifully misshapen romanesco cauliflower, tender and huge stalks of purple asparagus and a variety of luscious citrus without stickers attached.",512403

3,This is the mall I go to when its to hot to visit Town Square or for something different. They have alot of stores I like and the food court is nice. They even have a toddler play area there..which can be handy after a few hours of your little one being in a stroller.\nDuring Easter they have a cute bunny for the kids to take pix with but @ Xmas the Santa is better @ Town Square. He has his own house there.\nI still manage to get here every couple of weeks and usually leave with a bag from somewhere..,278159
1,Very dissappointed after all the 2nd hand hype..... The Burgers and fries LOOK great when served....but are very bland....The peanuts taste better than the burger. In the end I put this chain in somewhere between In N out and a Wendy's...with In N Out getting the edge. Definetly not worth the wait you see at lunch time...Better off going to red robins or grabbing a 5 dollar burger at Carls Jr. Soooo much grease/oil....soooo little taste!,503697

2,"I have been twice now.  The first time was a Wednesday night with a friend of mine.  We met at 6pm and stayed for over 2 hours.  In that time I only saw 2 people come in to get take out.  The second time was Monday (a holiday) at 4:30pm.  I saw one person come in for dinner.  I don't know how they stay open!\n\nThat said they have been in business since 1983!!  That is amazing to me.  I have lived here for 12 years and never even noticed or heard of the restaurant on Southern, near Dobson Rd.\n\nI find the prices to be a great deal.  The kids meal is $4.50 and comes on a cute brightly colored fish plate.  It contained teriyaki chicken with rice, a chicken skewer, a gyoza (pot sticker), fresh grapes and edamame.  A drink was also included in the price.  The first drink he brought out for my three kids was a bottle of sunny delight.  The kids were thrilled but opened it and it tasted funny.  I checked the date and it was expired.  The owner was apologetic and brought out peach and pineapple drinks in a can.  The kids were happy with that as well.  They all ate amazingly well... very happy with the kids meal.\n\nI got the tofu teriyaki the first time and the tofu sukiyaki the second time.  Both were good.  Served on a tray with rice, miso soup, edamame and a salad with ginger dressing and 2 pieces of agadashi tofu.  The price is $9.  \n\nI am a fan of the iced green tea.",33527

With all due respect to you your family and your establishment God bless you Larry keep keeping the food coming out good just get rid of this guy ASAP he will ruin your restaurant!

1,We booked through Travelocity and booked out a compact.  They are saying it is a compact CARGO van. They make you pay per mile that you drive but they don't disclose that until you get here. They need to fix something with their system and with Travelocity. At least the manager hooked us up with a mini van that had seats in it for the same price!  Ha. I had to give them another star for that!,604290

The decor/design of the place is way cool, the staff seems to think they are to good to be serving others, but whatever. I recomend this place if you are in the area but not worth any kinda trek.",229262

I was excited because I had eaten brunch here before and really enjoyed it.\n\nArrived at 12:35 for our 12:30 reservation and checked in - the hostess said she would get us when our table was ready.  We had delicious bloody mary's at the bar and we were seated at about 12:50, right next to the closed off smoking area.  However, every time the door opened a draft of smoke filled air blew right into our table - I would suggest they actually remove that table and not seat anyone there.\n\nAbout 1pm the waiter came around to take our drink orders (he likely saw that two of us had drinks already) and came back at about 1:10 for our brunch orders.  These came out at 2pm!\n\nMy breakfast was fine (straight up breakfast) but not piping hot, my mother's (Italian omelet) the same, but my brother's biscuits and gravy were cold.  The waiter brought them back to heat them up, but by then they were nearly inedible.\n\nNot sure if they were just having some problems that day with service - a lot of people out sick? - but the experience was really quite bad.  As someone who thinks of brunch as a weekend staple, I may try again but for a restaurant at this level I would expect service to be considerably better.",79751
3,I have only had the bagels here but they are real good.  They definitely have a distinct taste that sets them apart from other bagel places.  To me these bagels taste a bit saltier then some other chain places which I enjoy.  It may just be in my head though lol.  The bagels run larger then most bagel shops.  The prices are excellent.  I need to eventually try some of their other breakfast options they look amazing.,317774

2,"So here's the deal... if you want a motel quality room, in a prime location, and a cheap (for vegas) price... then this place may just work for you.\n\nHubby and I stayed here for our Couple's shower because we could get a suite for $100 a night. While the room wasn't anything special, it was decent. The whole room was huge, there were mirrors over the bed (classy!), and it had the craziest shower/bath I had ever scene! The whole thing was surrounded by mirrors and glass. When it got fogged over it was a bit like something out of some scary movie however. Oh, and you have to be 5ft tall or shorter if you want to take a shower. Unless you don't mind knelling in the tub. But, they kept the room clean and it was in a great location.\n\nRoom service was decent. However, I wouldn't waste money eating anywhere else in the hotel. Not a good food selection. The casino is well equipped with a variety of slot machines, which is nice for the slot machine junkies (like myself). The car show is worth seeing and pretty reasonably priced. Definitely something I would do again.\n\nI wouldn't recommend staying in the expansion on the back. A couple of my girlfriends stayed back there, and had to be escorted to their room by one of the guys every night. You know it's a bad location when you can smell the drugs walking through the halls and see a naked man running out of his room while arguing with his wife/girlfriend.\n\nOverall, an ok place if you are traveling on a budget. Just go elsewhere to eat and avoid the expansion!",166851

0,"Horrible. After hearing so much about Grimaldis and the lack of good pizza on the west side of the Las Vegas valley I thought I'd give it a try since I live less than 2 miles away. While ordering I asked for a side of pizza sauce and they asked if I wanted to come in to pick it up or if I wanted curbside pickup. I asked for curbside. They said 20-25 minutes. I left right away and arrived there 10 mins. after placing my order.  I parked in front and after 5 mins of waiting I decided to go inside. To my surprise it was already at the bar waiting. If it was ready why didn't they check to see if I was there to give me my pizza? And after sitting at the bar for who knows how long the pizza was cold. I got home 24 mins. after ordering my pizza. If I had waited the time they told me I would have picked up an even harder, colder pizza. The sauce was refrigerator cold which was annoying. The pizza was paper plate thin and although I ordered extra cheese it barely had any. I had to reheat the pizza when I got home but even so it was horrible. For $25 the largest pizza they had was so thin that all 8 pieces barely filled my wife and I. Metro pizza is much better and half a pizza fills us both. Will never go there again",502625

4,"Just reviewing this club is distracting me enough to lead me off into a hangover daydream... Las Vegas is it's own party bubble atmosphere and XS is definitely one of the highlights of that party. The serene, elegant, lavish, sexy, and bold environment and decor are both refreshing and exciting. It is one of the most spacious and welcoming clubs in LV with a wide indoor dancefloor, VIP seating, and luxurious high ceilings with chandeliers that sparkle with the lighting. But wait until your bright doey eyes behold the outdoor patio equipped with a full poolside bar, beautifully lit, large pool, a lovely nightsky view, and even more space to shake that thang!!! The crowd is a mix of happy party-goers, mostly young in age having a good time. I haven't been there when the pool is open, but I'm excited for that on my next trip.\n\nI don't know how much cover is, but I'm sure it's worth it for the people that have to pay. However, tip for the girls: Talk to the random promoters along the strip because they can get you into clubs (including XS) for free through the guestlist! We even got a few guys in for free. So make sure you spread your social butterfly wings and make friends in Vegas because it pays off! I went to the bar earlier so its wasn't too hard to get a drink, but I saw that it got crowded later in the night, so be prepared. The danclefloor in and out are spacious enough and built in a way to prevent too much cramping and crowding, which is a plus. The bouncers/security are generally nice and helpful, especially considering the crazies and drunks they have to deal with... one of my friends had to be \""politely escorted\"" out.. haha. \n\nXS is definitely one of the lovely gems of Las Vegas, so make sure you show some love and dance moves and pay it a visit. The 5 star ratings speak for themselves! It's definitely a good time baby!",365676

If you are inside the Caesar Palace or in the vicinity and want chinese food, go to this place instead of the chinese place at the Forum food court. The food is pretty good. The specialty item is the handpull noodle with different topping, with the pork/mushroom as being the most popular. I did try that and was happy with it. I do eat in the San Gabriel valley a lot and I think this place is pretty good. The food cost anywhere from $9-$30 per dish, which is still cheaper than any other sit down chinese restaurants at the Bellagio, The Aria, or the Wynn.

Ordered items missed and/or served under or over cooked, no checking on drinks, and no quality checks.  Just like the Eiffel Tower restaurant in this hotel, this establishment goes in the \""poser\"" category - a place with the facade of a high-end food experience with the reality of an Applebees. \n\nI discussed the evening with the shift manager...she took the automatic 18% tip off of the bill then told us that we \""were only hurting the servers\"" (out of guilt, we tipped back about 10%).

The $12 specialty margaritas DID NOT produce a buzz and I COULD NOT taste the tequila. Yes, I SAID IT, 12 DOLLARS!!  (Pint size with ice)  I guess if i order a $12 drink, I expect to taste some liquor in it and it should probably come in a giant margarita glass, like at Arriba's.  I think that the owners are cheap and trying to lure a snooty crowd that likes to show their friends how to properly waste some perfectly good money!!!  I had been to the old location several times.  Won't find me coming back to the new location though.  You've failed to retain an old customer.  Oh,  and the valet parking is just irritating.

I mean, what makes a hamburger great is that its approachable by everyone, regardless of economics.  Perhaps thats why it has come to be synonymous with America...that it crosses boundaries.   Not here however, these burgers are decidedly expensive and in reality no better than anything you'd find at your favorite local burger joint.  \n\nJust because you use the word \""kobe\"" or \""danish blue cheese\"" doesn't mean you have the right to charge $20 bucks for a burger...but apparently here it does.  Another thing is one would think a gourmet burger place would have gourmet fries right?  Wrong...here the fries were so mediocre I was yearning for Chili's.......yep, thats right I said Chili's and now I must shower to wash the shame off my body.  \n\nI had Hubert's favorite burger which was composed of Buffalo, Bleu Cheese and sherry shallot reduction sauce.

My mom had the sliders and reported them as being ok as well, but nothing special.\n\nService was average but not very friendly.  I mean I would have a smile if I was getting a 10 dollar tip for bringing out two hamburgers and a couple soda pops but who am I to judge?\n\nOne positive thing to note was Burger Bar did have a nice beer selection with some unique options at decent prices.  Its nice to be free from the normal yoke of beer oppression perpetrated by the casinos.\n\nI for one can pass on this place again but judging by the crowd there and the reviews on Yelp, most people disagree.....Twilight Zone I tells ya!!!!",155345
3,"This is the first time I had Japanese hot pot and I am hooked. Usually hot pot places aren't too thrilling or the greatest thing in the world to me, but after coming here it is life changing (or at least opinion changing). \n\nGuess what they had on their menu that caught my eyes... a mushroom party plate!! I cannot stress enough on how much I love mushrooms. I LOVE IT!! *does a little dance* This plate has 6 or 7 different types of mushrooms and a second plate full of vegetables with noodles. You can either eat your main course with rice or ramen soup style. \n\nWhen I come back to Vegas, this is definitely one of the places I would revisit.",223948

2,"Stayed here last week during my 4th trip to Las Vegas.   Harrah's sent me an offer for 2 nights comped and thus I decided to take them up on it since I have \""given\"" them plenty of money over the years at their various casinos around the country.  Hey, if it's for free it's for me.\n\nThis is not the nicest nor the worst hotel on the Strip; the rooms are clean and the location is great but it could use some updating.  The property in Lake Tahoe is nicer and I hear the AC flagship is their nicest under the Harrah's name but the LV branch was acceptable.   I don't think I would pay to stay here since there are so many more luxurious options in LV that you can find for a deal if you book ahead but I can't complain over a free room.  The casino was one of the busier ones at night (due to the location or perhaps due to the Carnival Court outdoor party that goes on all night and attracts frat boys galore) but it was not unbearably busy and the cocktail waitress did come around often.  Toby Keith's I Love this Bar & Grill and Kerry Simon's KGB are both good and prices were reasonable (separate reviews to follow for the restaurants). \n\nHarrah's can best be summed up as being a good place to stay for those on a budget that still have standards.  Cheaper rooms can be found (Imperial Palace, Circus Circus, Riviera) but I have heard horror stories regarding cleanliness.  The fact that they don't charge resort fees is a huge plus and the Total Rewards program is one of the better casino rewards programs around.",128909

When he brought it up to server, she said all of our burgers are prepared medium well.  Would have been great if she stated that or asked when he ordered.  In all fairness she did offer to re order it.  We had to get going so he declined.  Dont think I will go back, too many options in this part of town with far superior food.",371978
2,"I was really excited about this place before walking in because Butcher and the Rye is really hard to get a reservation.\n \nFOOD - I had mussels, marrow, pig candy, duck liver pate, and wagyu flank steak. The portions were good, price were good, and everything tasted good. Though we ordered our steak medium rare, it seemed a little overcooked and asked them to make it again for us, which was again a little overcooked. Overall, other than the duck liver pate, everything was mediocre.\n\nSERVICE - service was excellent!\n\nENVIRONMENT -  I liked the vibe of the place, and it would be a great place to grab a drink and eat appetizers. It won't be a good place to bring kids or for a large group of people.\n\nI gave three stars to the place because although there was nothing that bothered me, they weren't excellent. I probably will not come back here and rather go to Meat and Potatoes.",623150

Went in to play a few games and was promptly harassed by a, fat, greasy security guard who thought it would be amusing to try and walk away with my drivers license.

Stick it to the Man, man!) \nClose to Waverley Station and nought but a short walk over North Bridge. It's got a nice cosy cave-like feel to it, ideal for gigs. Now I've not been on a 'night out' here and to be honest I'm not exactly bothered by that. Dark nooks & crannies are my favourite spots but no need to take a sudden deep interest in your shoes; your fellow patrons are friendly and it's not hard to strike up a pleasant conversation here. \nThere's one thing I really dislike about Cabaret Voltaire though and I think it puts a dampener on things; come 10pm, no matter, the place gets cleared out for a club night at 11pm. It's like your parents coming home annoyingly early and chucking your pals out. As well as you. And the entertainment. Uncool in my opinion. \n\nA-OK-and a half.",357765

With our first visit , after church on a Sunday morning we decided to have breakfast and was happily greeted immediately. The room was bright, very clean, and welcoming. \n\nThey had a great selection on their menu. Different thing's you wouldn't find anywhere else.  Like breakfast nachos (which is one of my favorites) The food came out fast, fresh, hot, and very delicious staff constantly checked up on us and our drinks never went empty. \n\nThe family and I decided that this was the perfect place for our mom's party. With months leading up to it we would have our Sunday morning breakfast here and never had an incident that we were disappointed.\n\nA few days before the party, they got together with me to discuss decorations.\n\nLet me tell you that the staff went above and beyond my expectations.\n\nThe party was a BLAST!!  More than 85 people could do nothing but say what a great place this was, especially with the birthday girl :)\nThe food, decorations, staff, DJ, bartender ... everything was tremendous!!\n\nThe place is roomy, delightful, and super clean. If you are looking for a place that puts good quality in their food this is the place. But if you are going to critique over decor... come on now... get a life!! It's perfect the way it is and you don't find many places that pride themselves with the delicious food they serve.\n\nThank you so much to \"" A Thyme for all Seasons\"" especially Mr. Michael, Ms. Monica, and Ms. Laura... you guys are the best and better than any party venue in town!!

IT'S SO FAR.\"" In reality - a $30 cab ride split between 4 of us was WELL worth it. \n\nDelicious food. Our waitress was very attentive. Our chef was hilarious, easygoing, fun, and obviously a great cook.\n\nDefinitely try the shrimp tempura roll... one of the best I've had.

4,"I  love this place. This is like a mini version of a Fresh and Easy Market Filipino style. It's a lifesaver if you realize you're out of something like a can of coconut milk or some dried fish or sweet rice flour which is one item I bought today.  Before you drive a half hour or so to Seafood City, come here instead. There is a little of everything you need to make your favorite Filipino dish.  My mom lives 2 miles away, and always sends me or my brother here to get this and that. For North Vegas residents, it's a stress free and rather fun drive.\n\nThis is a family run business, and the service is great.  Unless they're super busy I always ask where the item is that I need.  They'll walk you right over to it, and you can then spend all the time you need to decide which brand to buy.  Of course, I end up asking \""Which of these two are more popular\""  And they give their honest opinion.\n\nI like that in season, they have some fresh produce. They have some freshly roasted peanuts which were $1.90 a pound.  We actually boil them for a nice snack. Almost always they have cooking bananas, sometimes they have papayas, fresh coconut, oranges, melons, etc. My mom often sends us here to get various noodles for pancit, along with lumpia, perhaps the most popular Filipino dishes. The dish that most of our friends love the most is dinuguan, roughly translated, \""made from  pork blood\"".  When you add coconut milk lean pork, vinegar, salt, and sometimes innards like intestines, spices like bay leaf and black pepper, garlic, onion, etc...the flavor is quite unique, mild slightly sweet. My doc says this is a great dish if you have iron poor blood. \n\nAt the front counter are desserts made by Valerio's bakery. I find myself always buying something sweet.  This trip for $10 I bought a taro and sweet rice tootsie roll shaped dessert coated with coconut called Puto Bong Bong.  They also had a multi layer, multi colored sweet rice cake called Sapin Sapin. There were lots more, but everything in moderation  \n\nWe've been customers since 2007 and will continue to be as long as they're around.",616068

The blind date experience was okay; thank God they have $5 martinis-of-the-day.  \n\nMy return visit with my partner (not the blind date) and his kids was more enjoyable, but still nothing spectacular.  Dragon Fly offers your basic Chinese dishes that you'd find on a Chinese take-out menu, but they serve them to you in their dining room.  Good, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nOur server wasn't very attentive until the very end when we didn't want him to be.  We were seated and brought some of those crunchy Chinese noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard sauce.  With five of us, they were gone in no time and we never did see a refill.  And I liked that they had a $5 sour apple martini drink special, but my 2nd martini didn't come until I was done eating my meal.  It kind of ruins the excitement of drinking a martini when it's served as dessert.  Well...mostly.  Toward the end of the meal (not at the end, but toward the end), our server started clearing our dishes off our table before we were even finished!   My partner had turned away for a second and someone scarfed up his plate with some food still on it.  This infuriated my partner, but I, surprisingly, wasn't as bothered.  Maybe it was because I knew that \""dessert\"" was coming?  \n\nAt any rate, the food is average, drink specials on martinis are great, and the service is slow, but keep an eye on your plate.

1,"I had been to this theater many times in the past but after a recent trip I had to ask myself, what happened? Over priced tickets for movies that have been out for several months, I do not think so. I went there with my nephew to see one of those Disney kid flicks and could not believe they had a huge line being handled by only 2 people. \n\nHere it is over 100 degrees and me waiting in line. So I decide to go inside and buy tickets from the ticket kiosk. Big mistake!! The machine did not work correctly and told me that it could not complete the transaction. So after speaking to a clueless manager who acted like I was wasting her time by asking for her help,  she goes and prints out two tickets. So before we headed into the movie we stopped to get a drink at the concession stand. Guess what? \n\nAnother big line with only one or two people working. So after paying 4 dollars for a drink and $3.50 for a small popcorn that was old and stale ( requested fresh popcorn) I made a quick stop at the bathroom. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. It was dirty, with paper towels on the ground and toilets that would not flush. \n\nTo top it all off later that evening I found out that I had been charged 100 dollars for two tickets!! Turns out the ticket machine put through the charge but would not print my tickets. When I called the theater they said it happens all the time. \nThey offered no solution to the problem and I had to spend three hours on the phone with the bank to get the charges reversed.

I'm from the Philippines tho so I don't mind much but for American standards it's something to think about.,306119
2,"Stadium is in the heart of downtown, surrounded by hotels.  Parking is different because of space and location.  Parking lot fees vary from $10 to $50.  If you are lucky on game day to find a lot with vacancies, otherwise go online and reserve a spot for $15.00.  Some lots guarantee security and restrooms and an attendant all day.  Now the stadium adheres to all of the newest NFL guidelines pertaining to what you can bring into the stadium.  Ladies were turned away because they had larger than regulation purses.  Those of you with seat cushions read the guidelines.  Diaper bags, another no no.  Parents were instructed to return to their vehicle and only bring what was necessary.  Food concessions was a big disappointment.  Bogangles were all over the place.  Other sports complexes over a superior variety, and your choices were limited here.  Was disappointed, since the web site had limited ticket availability, and yet there were way to many empty seats.  Before and after the game the city police are controlling traffic.  Everything is orderly.  Did not see to many venders parading up and down the sections.  Apparently, the stadium wants you to leave your seat.  Which may explain the enormous amount of flat screen TV's broadcasting the game on the concourse.",6473

A sister of a of the instructors was working on a new dance piece and for it she specifically need untrained dancers will to be fools in front of recording equipment. Of course I signed up. \n\nI can't speak to the classes here, but now that I know it's there I'd recommend checking them out. It's easy to find in Plaza Midwood tucked right next door to Yoga One. The whole space is clean and well organized space with studios spaces in various sizes.

3,"A really good branch of a fantastic Edinburgh coffee company.\n\nUnlike Starbuck's laboured \""cosmopolitan\"" style, this place really does feel cool. Inside is a wooden, natural aesthetic, with low level lighting that makes the place feel like some strange forest haven.\n\nI first visited Black Medicine when staying over at a friends. In the morning we came here for breakfast and I enjoyed a lovely croissant and cappacino. Since being back I've tried their smoothies several times and I have to agree with Gavin!

1,"The food was very impressive.  The experience was what ruined the entire evening.  The noise level was quite loud, but nothing that I haven't experienced before.  We made a reservation and were really looking forward to some great sushi.  We ordered edamame to start with, the Samba Sushi Chef's Selection and a dragon roll.  The waitress recommended we get more, even though we had already run through the menu with her and settled on what we would be ordering.  The edamame arrived, and seriously 30 seconds later all the sushi made its way to the table.  We maybe spent 30 total minutes at the restaurant.  It was a overall a really unfortunate experience, and had it not been for the food, it would have been truly awful.",312520
3,"Ahhhhhhh....this was my first trip to Vegas that was not a blow-out girls trip. Instead, I tagged along with my poker-lovin' travelin' man (after assuring him I wouldn't cramp his table style), so I had a decent amount of time on my hands during the day. Cue spa day! \n\nI scheduled a 50 minute Ashiatsu massage because I can't seem to find anyone who does them in Atlanta and, if you really like deep tissue massage, there is truly nothing like it. The therapist massages you with his or her FEET! And no, they're not just walking on your back like my parents had me do when I was a kid, they are truly *massaging* you with those footsies, while holding on to bars bolted into the ceiling. I just can't describe it properly - it's freakin' amazing. \n\nI generally say \""no preference\"" when it comes to gender of the stranger who will be rubbin' away but had a mild moment of regret when my dude came to get me from the lounge - ewww boys' feet are YUCKY! Wow, I got over that real fast. This is going to come across wrong, but that man REALLY knew how to use his feet!\n\nThe massage was over before I knew it, as they do, but the noon poker tourney had just gotten started, so I took my time and took full advantage of every single amenity that spa had to offer. The women-only wet area is like most - hot jacuzzi, cold plunge pool, and a small \""warm\"" jacuzzi as well - as Goldilocks would say, it was juuuuust right. Eucalyptus steam room sweated Saturday night right out of me and the Redwood Sauna gave my skin a glow. Most ladies kept their swimsuits on, but a few free spirits went topless. The coed areas include the waiting lounge, a salt room, hot stone beds, and outdoor soaking pool overlooking the Liquid Lounge. Salt room was totally weird - Trekkie-esque lounge chairs and vibrating new age music. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting it to smell like the seaside, and instead it felt kind of cold and sterile, but stick around for a while - eventually you'll start to feel the effect of the salt cleaning out those sinuses. \n\nI'm not completely embarrassed to admit that my favorite part just might have been the sheer abundance of US Weekly and People magazines casually lying about in each room...oh yes, sometimes I just adore being a girl!",392901
3,"So I really wanted to Yelp something today. So, a buddy (@groovypucks) and I went to Thai Lahna.  I noticed it had a LOT of reviews and still maintained a pretty reputable score!  Hey, its only a block or two from work, so why not?\n\nWe get there and are immediately seated which in my opinion is rare.  For the rave reviews, I noticed it was kind of 'dead' for a lunch crowd.  A few old people and the owners were all I really noticed.  We get a booth seat (I love booth seats.  If I could work, sleep and eat in a booth seat, I would die a happy man) so I am already getting excited.  Groovypucks and I take way too long looking at the menu and finally decide on our dishes (which we accompanied with a Thai Tea).  I asked to make my curry spicy(#36 Yellow Curry Chicken with Green Beans), and it WAS!  Almost too spicy, but I attribute that to my lack of experience with their dishes.  If I were to order it again, I would order it medium.\n\nGroovy got a Peanut and Chicken dish (#35) with onions and peppers.  I tried a bit, as I am comfortable in my sexuality, and I really liked it.  It was Damn good! That's right, Capital D!  The service for the rest of the meal was below par, but not to the point that it was annoying.  It just took a little too long to get my food and my check at the end...\n\n...And with this review I leave you with my fortune\n\nIf strength were all,\ntiger would not fear scorpion.",24280
3,"I visited this area for the first time in March 2014 with my family. We were just experiencing the city and not looking for anything specific. All of us loved it, young and old. We loved the little shops, especially Pittsburgh Popcorn Factory, Art of Steel, the European market, various street vendors and the biscotti shop. Even if you fasted, you wouldn't be able to try it all in one day. \n\nThere are tons of food options from snacks to sit down restaurants. If I was local I would have such a great time experiencing all of the local wonders and flavors as well as take advantage of the fresh produce market which had incredibly low prices. \n\nI wish they'd close off the roadways in peak hours. There isn't much room to move on the sidewalks but there is also traffic so it's a struggle to get around, especially with a stroller. I wish there was a little more variety in shops because I can see it getting old year after year if there isn't variation.",319691

When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.\n\nZoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.\n\nThe food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator.

1,"I came in here on a Saturday morning a little after 9am.  The gentleman who was working on my pedi started clipping my nails with a cuticle nipper.  I thought it was really odd, I've never seen anyone use cuticle nippers to clip nails, especially for my nails, which were long overdue for a pedi.  Anyway, I wished he trimmed down the nails some more (I should have said something).  As he was clipping my big toes with this nipper, it hurt so bad I started saying, \""ouch!\"" but he ignored my whining and went on to clipping.  Later, he went on to scrub the bottoms of my feet, and that, itself was not good because he did it so lightly that it was the uncomfortable ticklish feeling.  The nail painting itself was good though, and I was out of there in about 40 minutes, including drying time.\n\nI should add, when I walked in, there was another woman who already had her pedi started.  I was already done, and she was only halfway done.  So depending on who you get, you'll either get really fast service, or really slow service.  She commented on it to the man who was doing her nails, but disregarded what she had to say.  She also commented as the guy was scrubbing her feet, how that experience was, \""not a good one,\"" to say the least.\n\nThe only reason I stopped by here is because they open at 9am on Saturday.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",438984

2,"Frederico Fellini was a brillant and enigmatic Italian director of films in the 50's, 60's and 70's. 4 of his films won an Oscar for best foreign film.\nIf you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . \n\nHis movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. \n\nHe is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.\n\nThis Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. \n\nThe Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.\n\nService was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. \n\nInside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film.

We had the potato soup (pretty average), a chicken parm sandwich (portion small and doesn't come with pasta like the other sandwiches), grilled cheese (average), and pancakes (average). \n\nThe service was lackluster and the restaurant has that smell when you enter a rest home.

I have been trying to order something site-to-store from the parent company website for three days.  First, they advertised it as one price but as soon as it went into my cart it showed up as costing $100 more!  Because of our timeline, I ordered the item.  Well, Guitar Center must have a HUGE amount of fraud, because my credit card was instantly shut down (and I buy a lot of weird stuff, a lot of stuff online, spend money in different countries all the time, etc--this was NOT an expensive item, either)..  WOW!  So once I get that cleared up, I sent a screen shot of the original price--a price that I had confirmed via telephone with GC CS rep Preston.  They \""lost\"" my first screen shot.  I re-sent it, and uploaded it to a server to provide them with a URL...so this time they couldn't lose it.  All the while, EVERY agent asked me to call them on the phone to re-order.  I went through a friend's affiliate link after they told me about GC, giving them appropriate credit for the sale--so this unscrupulous company was actually trying to get out of giving credit under the terms of their OWN affiliate program!  So now they're claiming they have to cancel my order and I have to re-order via the phone, or they cannot honor their own coupon code.\n\nWell, the STORE might be just fine.  I don't know.  I didn't make it that far.  But I can tell you that the parent operation is questionable.  I'd rather give my business to a more ethical operation.

THe shrimp fried rice was meh, although the veggie fried rice was pretty good (they were about a 1/3 cup serving each). The maitake with truffle butter was absolutely delicious (about 5 mushrooms), the steak was just ok. The bok choy was very VERY good. The portions were miniscule. The fingerlng potatoes were literally TWO potatoes, halved. For desert we had a flavored creme brulee, or at least they called it creme brulee. I like my creme brulee to have a crisp candy coating, and whatever flavor you add should not turn the custard consistency to that of coffee grounds, but according to them, it was creme brulee and who am I to argue?\n\nPrice - Minus 2 stars. $10 for the two fingerling potatos. $30 for the boiled chicken. And $20 PER OUNCE for the steak. Don't make me do math!!!! just price the damn thing $80 or $100 and be done with it.. Making me decide how many ounces to pay for (and watching you weigh it out!!!!) is just nickle and diming me. It just feels petty. \n\nHow about a prix fixe menu? Since you've only got a few things to choose from anyway?\n\nStaff - Plus 1 star. They were really nice and friendly and helpful. And you're not giving them much to work with, so I really hope you pay them well.\n\nBoiled chicken, FFS. Ugh. I feel like deducting another star just from the thought of it.

I really put a lot of time into deciding to go with the old reliable craft steak or trying the new restaurant. Should have gone to craft. \nfirst impression: The place is not as big or up scale as craft. They had plenty of staff but the service was not fluent, ok its a new restaurant and they are working out the kinks. Ordered drinks, took a while, ok we werent there to get drunk so no biggie. ordered the lamb ribs, hamachi, and the ash bone marrow. the hamachi and the ribs were phenomenal, the bone marrow (to my disappointment) was undercooked and didnt come with any toast so eating it was a bit weird. Ordered the tabasco peppered kobe skirt and my wife had the spice roasted lobster. The steak was ok at best, definitely not the same kobe skirt that they have at craft. The lobster was overcooked in my opinion and a bit tough to chew. For desert, we had mascarpone panna cotta which was very nice and tasty. oh yeah, and they were so nice to bring us a small bunt cake looking thing since I had notated in my reservation that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary. I am sorry, but if spending $300 per couple for dinner doesnt constitute a decent desert, then dont bother bringing me a dry little cake with a candle on it. overall, did not measure to the expectations, thought the menu wasnt impressive, lacked raw seafood and not a huge selection of steaks to choose from, etc. There are too many better steak houses in vegas for me to try heritage again, sorry Tom.",616433

We also split fire roasted asparagus and the best fries I've eaten outside of my own. Everything was absolutely fabulous and worth every dime.\n\nThe dessert menu was lengthy, and when we were informed that they make all the ice creams, sorbets and sherbets fresh the only question was what flavor.

When I checked in Monday I was given a room at the Mardi Gras Tower. To my disbelief I was shocked how small the room was. This room looked like a closet that was expanded. The room was so cramped as it appeared the bed was squished between the wall and balcony. The worst part of the room was it was located on the Strip where music was playing at the Carnival Court. When I tried to go to sleep at night I had to use earplugs. I enjoyed the vuvuzela sound four years ago at World Cup in South Africa than the noise from the Strip at night.\n\nThe reasons I didn't give a smaller rating were that I comped a room and swam at the pool.,129059
4,"Terrific street tacos! We tried the carna asada, shrimp, and fish.  All were excellent and reasonably priced.  Had the rice and pinto beans-nothing to write home about here, they should put some effort into these two areas (not horrible but they really don't compliment the awesome tacos.  I didn't see any horchata on the menu and would have liked some but the Mexican coke was delicious.  I'll be back!",500753

2,"The Golden Dragon has an east to find location right off of Rose street and unlike other Cantonese places in the city they do not require reservations. The staff was friendly and the food was pretty good. It was not the most amazing Chinese food I have ever had but for stumbling upon it on a cold Saturday night, it was great. I will probably try a new place before coming back, but for a quick dinner give it a shot.",353823
3,"I visited the lounge midweek  and have to admit I enjoyed myself. It wasn't a place that was over the top, but if you are able to visit its a good stop. I enjoyed the DJ providing a great blend of all party genres. The place provided enough room to dance and the drinks were strong. The one issue is theirs a lot of drunk people in the club also. The staff enjoys themselves which adds to the awesome club/lounge atmosphere.",615164

4,"Great waxing experience!\n\nI am from out of town and came with a friend. The staff was friendly and accommodating despite the fact that we had made our appointments just that morning.\n\nAbout my wax:\nI had a Brazilian wax and my \""waxpert\"" was Carla. I had been having trouble with ingrown hairs so she spent the first few minutes explaining about the different types of wax (they offer hard and soft w/strips) and learning about my hair and skin. Throughout the wax she talked me through and was very nice, like talking to a friend. They are very hygienic here, no double dipping! After the wax Carla went to great lengths to tweeze the ingrown hairs as well as recommend products (they have their own line). She really wanted to educate me even though she knew I lived out of town and may never come back! Great wax, great service. Whether you're a local or just passing through, you should DEFINITELY give this place a try.",526284
1,"Food was good, but service wasn't comparable.\nThe alcoholic drinks took a long time and the margarita was too thick (hadn't melted the entire time we were there), then the Bloody Mary was \""eh\"" & I never got my extra olives.

Long story short, the shape of my nails were crooked,  he forgot to put lotion on my feet and talked sh*t about me in Vietnamese the WHOLE TIME about me being too picky while the entire staff made bets on whether or not if I was going to leave a tip.\nI paid and left the man a tip anyway. \n\nI've never been so appalled,  humiliated and dissatisfied with a service. \nI asked for the manager and there was no manager avail.",21214
1,"I was a person that used to go to Serendipity since it opened in 09 and to be honest it  has been going downhill.  There were many problems I had with my last experience there a while back.\n1.  Prices are ridiculously expensive for majority of the food and drinks I remember when the Deep Fried Oreos used to be 14 dollars and now it's 18 IF you are a total rewards member\n2.  The ice cream I received for the Black and White Sundae was old.  The waiter tried telling me that they get \""Fresh\"" ice cream every day, but I'm a local who used to be a regular and I KNOW for a FACT how the ice cream is supposed to be like.  I'm pretty sure most of you know that when you put your spoon through ice cream it should be smooth and creamy, there SHOULD NOT BE ANY ice crystals inside of the ice cream making it a bit hard and chunky.  I mean its sad that the Ice cream at McDonald's is a lot more fresh than this place gave me for their Black N White Sundae.  Not only that but the Strawberry was pretty lazy to me if they raised the prices.  The reason why it's called a black and white sundae isn't because chocolate and vanilla ice cream, they used to have the strawberries in tuxedos now it's just half dipped in chocolate and white chocolate. I was dissatisfied with this and this was the first time I ever had to RETURN AN ORDER OF ICE CREAM\n3.  The LV Burger was OK wasn't really worth the price to me at all.  If the price was lowered a bit it would have been a lot better.\n4.  The people gave us the grasshopper in exchange for the horrible Black N White Sundae and it wasn't that great it was mediocre at best.  It was OK, but not anything too phenomenal at all.\n\nI would recommend just going here once now just to say you've been here or get like a Frozen Hot Chocolate to go, but other than that you can find something better",383044
2,"First of all, make sure you are coming from the west because trying to enter this place from the east is very difficult. Also, their parking lot is pretty small and difficult to maneuver. I decided to try this place because I kept passing it on my way to work and I remember seeing all the good reviews about it. I decided to order 2 donuts and asked if I could sub out the milk for the orange juice (combo #3), and you would've thought I had asked for free donuts. Unfortunately, I can't drink milk, so I thought it would be no problem to swap it out for oj (especially considering the milk was more expensive than the oj). Fine, I'll just get the donuts. I get up to pay, and find out my order has to be $2.50 or more to use a debit or credit card (mine came to $1.93). So I end up grabbing an oj, making it more expensive than if they had let me do the combo! Now for the donuts...I got a Boston Cream (my favorite), and it was not great. The donut itself and the chocolate were ok, but the cream on the inside was just gross. The sugar donut was ok, but again, not great. I will probably not be coming here again.",396893

3,"Went to see local bands play here last night with Amy D and her awesome friends.  Totally my kind of bar...dark, dirty, divey, and with killer bands playing.  Very spacious...but that could have something to do with the fact that the place wasn't really packed. \n\nI didn't drink this night, but I did notice that Budweiser was $6.  (Not a beer drinker, but that seems a little high, I think)  But somebody was buying the drinks.  I think last night was the first time I actually had a guy fall on top of me. (And I guess my response was priceless)\n\nThe bar is in a strip mall, so parking wasn't too bad.  (I think that I came at the right time, but be careful where you park or you may get towed) \n\nThe most important part of the night was that I saved Amy D's life...I removed a splinter from her hand.

It was really a crazy and wild party that has taken me so long to recover from that I'm behind on my reviews :o)\n\nThe rooms are a good size but there is nothing interesting about them.  The showers were OK but mine had a terrible drip that kept me up the first night and I had to have it fixed the following day.  The maid service was good and consistent.  They have a lot of problems with their room keys becoming demagnetized and I heard several people complaining about this.  It happened to me when I was coming back at 6:00am in the morning with blisters on my feet...so I wasn't happy about walking all the way back the front desk for a new key.\n\nThe pool area is nice but slippery.  I fell once and it was very embarrassing but then I saw several other people slip and fall too.  Yikes that seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen.\n\nThey have three restaurants on the premises and they are pretty good.  The casino is not that big but it has everything you could want.

The restaurants here are meh but I'm just partial to Bouchon in the Venetian :) \n\nI love that this hotel does not have a theme.  Just super chic with great art.  I wish we could have gone to the Chandelier bar but we were \""busy\"" napping and laying by the pool.\n\nOur room was gorgeous, had a view of the fountains, Paris balloon and Eiffel tower.  And they were able to accommodate us by giving us 2 adjoining rooms.  Only downsides were value for money (but probably good bc it may be deterring the trashiest) and the fact that we were in a wheelchair accessible room with no lip on the shower which made for some flooding.  Nothing that couldn't be fixed with a few towels.\n\nThe BLVD pool is amazing too.  Would LOVE to see a show here.",435840
2,"If the Tropicana were placed basically anywhere but in Las Vegas, it could potentially be a 4 star hotel. \u00a0But because it's located right on the Vegas strip, it loses its allure against all the glitz and glamour.\n\nThis joint recently underwent a remodel, and while there's nothing special about the casino or rooms, they're clean (a necessity for me no matter where I go). \u00a0The two annoying things about my room are that my sink/tub soap was not always refilled and someone left a dirty hand towel hanging on the shower curtain rod that housekeeping must have missed (for God knows how long).\u00a0\n\nBottom line, would I return? \u00a0While Tropicana wouldn't be my first choice, if the price were right (or even free like on this sweet visit), sure - why not? \u00a0Plus I'm a sucker for a complimentary warm chocolate chip cookie (upon check-in, you'll get a coupon - two if you sweet talk the front desk!).",370306
3,"We were looking to try something new in the area and this was one of our many bookmarked places that had some great Yelp! feedback, so away we went! The restaurant itself was really nicely laid out and had plenty of space for groups from small to large. We were seated right away and our server let us know he'd be with us shortly.  \n\nAfter looking over the menu for a bit, we both decided on our picks. I opted for the Hickory burger with a side of the baked potato soup, which was the soup of the day special. The burger was cooked to the medium I ordered, and had two healthy sized slices of Canadian bacon on top of it. The shredded cheddar was the big winner for me on this burger. The portion sizes are huge here, so be prepared to eat a ton, or get a box!\n\nOur server was really nice and took the time to answer a couple questions we had about the menu since both the husband and I have food allergies. The pricing is a bit high for options other than burgers / sandwiches, but the portion sizes are huge and the service is great, so for a nice date night out, it's a good option!\n\nOverall: A\nGood burger, nice server, and huge portions!",107276
1,"Thai me up and take me to a different Thai Restaurant. The price and the decor are the only things going for Galanga. \n\nThe RJ Food section gave them a cover story review and romanticized about the DIY Thai Iced Tea so since I am junkie for Thai Tea I had to experience this. The presentation was original with the tea iced cubes, but when I individually smelled one of the ingredients it smelled like nail polish remover. Ugh. Maybe my smeller was off so I continued making my tea combining all of the ingredients and it was a fail. I didn't enjoy it and spent most of my meal trying to make the damn tea taste better. FAIL. \n\nNow for the food, the only thing going for it is the price. My lunch was $4.95 and came with soup or rice porridge which fell flat in the flavor department. Both my friend and I tried to dress it up with Sriracha, but decided it still didn't work for us. Second out of the kitchen was the Papaya Salad for $7.95. This tasted different than others around the valley which was due to the lime vinaigrette. It was bitter and missing something sweet or spicy to balance it out. Sad because minus the dressing this may have been a winner. Last to arrive was my Panang Curry Chicken. The portion was to my liking and the chicken appeared to be all white meat which usually makes me happy, but with one bite I knew I would never be back. It wasn't so bad that I spit it out, but it was just boring. Nothing should be boring about Curry especially when you order it at the highest heat level. The sauce lacked thickness and spice. It was at a toddler heat level which just pissed me off. This white girl likes it spicy! \n\nThe conclusion to this story is just because a restaurant looks good and the RJ raves about it doesn't mean shit. I will gladly spend double the price for authentic Thai then come to this fancy shmanzy crap hole again.",368331
1,rude staff except the guy at check in. We opted for go-green (no maid service) . we were supposed to get the $8 credit for that. We never got that and the lady on the phone was rude rude...absolutely ridiculous. \nold hotel..resort fees is a joke.,161356
1,I was with citizens Bank of Massachusetts for 10 years. We  relocated to Squirrel hill and I thought that the service would be just as good. Unfortunately the service got worse. Extremely long lines at the squirrel Hill branch and managers that have their hands tied and can't do anything to help fix problems. Any issues you may have you have to call the 800 number and you have long hold times. I like a bank where I can go in and talk to somebody and I can get something done. I am not a fan of citizens Bank.,77732
2,My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for our anniversary since everyone recommended it to us. We went here on a Friday night; reservations for 7:30 and we were seated around 7:45. Not bad! It was pretty busy which I expected since it was a Friday. \n\nWhen we were seated our server explained the red side and green side. I noticed all the meat they had and the salad bar. I decided to go to the salad bar before eating some meat. The salad bar looked delicious! I was excited to see that they had lobster bisque as the soup of the day. \n\nThey had a lot of meat to choose from. I wasn't too impressed with some of the meat because some of it was loaded with sodium. The chicken was a little dry and the sausage was just a-ok.,347547
1,"I had a hankering for thai food a couple weeks ago and found these guys on Yelp.  I ordered about 40 bucks worth of various dishes... shrimp pad thai, green curry chicken, spring rolls, a thai iced tea and I think that was it.  I don't remember all that well because most of the food went into the trash.  The iced tea was about the only thing that was exceptional.  Everything else was pretty much blah.  Not a lot of meat, and the curry was super greasy.  The pad thai was dry and tasted like it was anything but fresh.  My quest for GREAT thai food continues.  The one thing that surprised me is that when I went to pick up my order, their dining room was packed with lunch guests.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes (???)",227668

3,"Best, most authentic Italian ever?  Well, perhaps not.  Dang good, dang unhealthy Americanized Italian?  Yes, indeed.\n\nOk, people... if you're going to a place named \""Mama Ricotta's,\"" you shouldn't be expecting it to be terribly authentic.  But it is much better than Olive Garden.  The food is horrible for you, but delicious.  On our first visit, I had the tortellini special, which really impressed me.  The little pastas were perfectly cheesy, and the meat sauce was amazing.  It actually had little chunks of steak in it instead of ground beef.  My mouth is watering as I write this review, honestly.\n\nThe only part of the experience that was less than ideal was the goat cheese appetizer.  It came highly recommended, and it was tasty, but it lacked tanginess.  I probably wouldn't have been as let down if my expectations had not been so high.\n\nMama Ricotta's is comfort.  Good ol' Americanized comfort.  Mmm.",7161
2,"Mmmmm.  Popcorn.  Many, many flavors of popcorn.  Sweet, savory.  Chocolate, nuts.  Buttery, salty.  All of it.  And MPK does it well.  I love that they offer mini bags ranging from $2-$6.  Forced portion control.  If I was given a barrel of popcorn, I would somehow manage to get it down.\n\nSo why only 3 stars?  Less than impressive customer service.  Now the lady at the front (owner?) is great.  Very helpful and friendly.  The girls in the back...not so great.  I was in before Christmas to buy 13 mini bags...all different.  Although there were numerous people in the back, there seemed to be more socializing than actual work going on.  It took a good 20 minutes or so to get my order ready.  I could have eaten the product faster than they packed it.  No worries.  The shop is fun to browse.  But when my order was finally ready and I was heading out the door, an employee came out with a bag that they had missed.  At this point, I knew they probably did not bother to double check my order, so I did it when I got to my car.  Even with the bag they missed, I was still missing one...a $6 bag at that.\n\nAgain, the lady at the front was very apologetic, but the gal working in the back was argumentative as she \""knew\"" she had packed that particular flavor.  She came out front to get my entire bag, so that she could go through it herself and see what was missed.  Apparently, I am both a liar, illiterate, and unable to count to 13.  So now I'm waiting again with nothing to do but wonder why they didn't do this before they gave me the order.  Finally, she was sufficiently convinced the missing bag was, indeed, missing.  Upon returning my order, she remarked it had been packed, but not given to me.\n\nI still might not have dropped my rating if not for the fact that while I was waiting for the sleuth in the back to solve her case, another customer came in complaining that she was missing 5 bags of her 20 bag order.  Unfortunately for her, the order was for an office function that had already taken place.\n\nSo moral of my long-winded review is to give MPK a shot if you're a popcorn lover, but make sure you check your order before you leave.  They won't.",563189

3,"My second trip ever to the Stratosphere, and I still like it.  Sure, it's not a five star mega-casino a mile down the strip, but it's actually affordable.  The Deuce stops right outside the casino near the buffet and runs from Fremont Street to the Mandalay, with enough stops in between to get you where you want to go.  As for the surrounding area, you can actually walk outside and get a decent price on some food, or a bottle of liquor, for those looking to enjoy Vegas on a budget.  The rides were okay, the Big Shot being the only must do, but the views are awesome and the place is nowhere near as crowded as most of the strip casinos.  I highly recommend the strat, particularly the upgraded Select rooms.  My only negative applies to all of Vegas, as I am a non-smoker.  Nothing is more ridiculous than watching 50 people walk through a casino get irritated as they walk by one idiot chain smoking at a slot machine.  Eventually Vegas will realize most Americans do not indulge in this disgusting habit and ban it in public venues.  Until then though, we'll just have to suffer if we want to visit.",153525

Could have cooked a little longer as broccoli was still completely hard and not even warm.   And the initial bowl is small.  For family of 4, it was expensive  for amount of food.  I was very excited for the restaurant to open up,  but overall  disappointed.  Felt like we rush thru the  entire process and  rushing us out the door.  Won't go again",606474

Price is less and also great taste and most of all, it doesnt give me that crash like Starbucks does. i love Coffeebean and its close to my home but times r tough so i come here when i need a treat.",440994
1,"I came here because I was lured by the coupons on Restaurant.com, and lets just say I m glad I used that coupon. There is no way I would pay full price for the quality of food I was served and the price listed. I got 6 very thin buttermilk pancakes for $7. And a slice of ham costs like $5? I got a better deal eating at the signatures with an all american breakfast platter that costs $11.  \n\nIf you are coming here to find some great steals on mom and pop style off the strip hidden gems, and this is definitely the wrong place. Its over priced, and not worth the hype and drive. Go some where else like Egg & I or your local hotel.",73568
4,"Bacon wrapped hotdog in the softest, melt in your mouth bun.  Pull a U-turn and do NOT pass this place by!   My bro-in-law whipped the fastest u-turn in a mini-van as we drove by and I was describing a Sonoran hot dog to him.   Not even kidding. \n\nBring cash.  Order two. Get it with everything (unless you hate onions like me, then just go right ahead and leave those off).  Don't forget to add avocado sauce.   \n\nTake 'em to go or enjoy them on the tables and chairs in the parking lot. \n\nI have taken out of town visitors, family and gone on date nights here.  You can't say it's not an authentic and memorable experience, that's for sure.    So glad Nogales Hot Dogs is just down the street from my house!",349638
1,What a joke!   Their food is good. But the service I just had for lunch was atrocious.   Ordered my food with an iced tea.    Received the ice tea at the bar and then had to ask the bartender for sweetener.    As I looked around the place was nearly empty.   The bartender walks away and I don't see him for another 5 minutes or so.     My iced tea was empty after two minutes and when I looked around for someone to give a refill.   Surprise.  No one is around.    I had to wait until my food arrived from it looked like a cook to get a refill from someone other than the bartender.   Of course with no ice in it.    Nice room temperature to it.   He also had to get me silverware. \nFrankly I was less than impressed with the service.    It wasn't until halfway done with my meal that the bartender comes by with a cup of ice and a spoon to tell me. The ice melts fast.    Gee.  I think it really melts fast when their is no ice in the refill cup too.   \n\nI am only giving two stars for the food which I believe is 4+ stars.   I am going to stick with delivery and takeout.    If you want to get better service go next door to the Persian restaurant.   They at least check on their patrons.,242483
0,"Horrible service.  Walked around the men's department for 30 minutes looking for a particular color/style pants.  \n\nDidn't see anyone in the department for a little while and just searched on my own.  About 10 minutes pass by I see an associate.  He doesn't acknowledge me or ask if I need help.  I continues to shop on my own.  \n\nBy the end of the 30 minutes I see he's asked two other people if they needed help.  It took him a while to approach each one.  During the time he asked the other two, I walked passed the associate twice and he walked next to me once.  Never once even acknowledging my presence.  \n\nI guess I'll take my business elsewhere like Armani.  They are always very friendly there.",617951
3,"Ritter's will never be a fine dining establishment. It will always be a diner. It will always be a standby. It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.\n\nEveryone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry. Every now and then, I do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it is tasty.",3441

2,"I had only gone to Downtown Las Vegas once before which was a gaudy experience, so I am happy this time around it was different. New Years Day, 2am, finding my way to the jail to wait outside until 4am hoping my boys would get released. It was freezing, people everywhere, and just waiting. Happy friggin New Years.\n\nThis time around it was nice and warm, I went for my friend's wedding, and we stayed at the Fremont.\n\nHave you been wanting to go to the Phillipines? \nDo you enjoy cheesy-ness?\nHave you been craving some Dunkin Donuts?\n\nWell you have found the right place! Come on down to Fremont. It was really cute. Walking around the casino, seeing all the Filipino lolas gambling and complaining in Tagalog to their hubbys. Reminded me of my BFF's family parties.\n\nI don't ever recall going to DD's so that was cool to try it. \n\nWe finally get to the hotel at like 1 or 2am, we pull up and it's valet only. It was a good thing and a bad thing. Good because we didn't have to drive round and round, park, and lug our luggage 5 miles like on the Strip. Bad because it piled up and sometimes we'd have to wait long but oh wellz.\nWe walk in and the lady at the Counter is as SWEET AS CAN BE. Very nice, helpful, and just plain sweet.\n\nThe room was okay. Not too bad, not too great, just meh. Right when I walk in my mama goes \""there's a red dot on the ground and I don't know what it is!\"" LOL... Ummm okay? We just avoided it. Whatever. It looked like Cool Aid. \nThe sink was tiny. Dude. What the F. Like seriously. \n\nWe just got ready and slept so it wasn't a big deal at all. I've stayed everywhere. Doesn't matter to me.\n\nOne thing I liked is that it's a short walk downstairs, to the room, to the car, to the Fremont Street Experience, and just to about everywhere. One gripe is that it's so far from the Strip but it was nice to get to check out Old School LV ya know?",121113
0,"My guests and I were seated and we asked for bread, as one couple had just gotten off a plane and they  were starved.  We got it 20 minutes later after asking 3 more times and threatening to leave.\n\nThe Calamari appetizer was the worst ever.  50% of the plate (not exagearting) was old breading, and the calamari was tough and overcooked.\n\nI ordered the Shrimp Risotto, which used to come with shrimp and scallops.   No more scallops.  But of course they raised the price on the dish anyway.   Welcome to new American dining.   Cut the food.  Raise the prices.\n\nBrio presents a nice atmosphere because it was physically well designed.  Problem is, they forgot to hire anyone who can cook or provide nice table service.",387677
0,"Dr. Luoung  placed a crown on me which became infected and incredibly painful. He then did a root canal and  drilled through the new crown he had just put on, and then said that he would replace the crown since he basically destroyed it. I went back a little later for a cleaning and he did not mention replacing the crown he drilled through. Then the crown collapsed. I went to him and said that the crown collapsed. He said that I needed to make an appointment before this happened !!! He refused to replace the now destroyed crown, because it now needed an implant. I should have sued him for this but for some reason I felt it wasn't worth the time and cost, and just decided to go somewhere else and have it taken care of, at great expense anyway. It had to be extracted ,($400.00) and an implant put in. ($2400.00) He didn't live up to his word and refused to fix his shoddy work that caused the infection in the first place!!!

3,"I was looking for last minute hotels and stumbled upon The Riviera. I saw they had an offer one bed deluxe suite for 60.00 that included your living room with a wet bar, 2 bathrooms, a bedroom with a huge bed with a balcony with a decent view to the strip 60  a night sounded awesome.Then I read the reviews and was terrified and of course there was no refund if we cancelled. When we got there checking it wasn't as terrible like people said, but of course we got there at 6pm when check in was at 3pm but we checked in with no problem. We stayed on the Monte Carlo tower on the 26th floor, the one bedroom deluxe suite was very spacious the rooms are outdated but they're not THAT bad what really is in need of a renovation are the bathrooms. \nThe Riviera isn't the typical glamorous hotel you see at the middle of the strip, it's a blast from the past. I thought it was nice being able to experience a much older hotel, it's pet friendly also. Getting to our room wasn't such a long walk like in the other hotels. It's pretty far from all the shows but that's nothing a simple cab ride or a car ride can fix. This hotel isn't as packed as others it's very nice to walk around or catch a break from the night life. Overall it was a nice stay I enjoyed it staff was friendly, I hope they begin to fix their bedrooms soon and update many things (:\nIf you want an updated nice bedroom ask for the Monaco tower",133615

0,"If you don't like having smooth, relaxing craps, and pleasure yourself in hot, anus ripping diarrhea, then look no further- Basha on Sherbrooke and University is the place for you!\n\nThis lovely little toilet nightmare is placed in the basement suite of an old, semi-abandoned office building, sharing its prime real estate with a shady currency exchange store that opens for only 3 hours a day and a Tim Hortons above it that, for lack of a better word, is as pleasurable in dining as is eating the asshole an obese computer technician named Fred.  The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.\n\nThe food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights.",337877
0,"BIRTHDAY FOR HUBBY UGH\nFirst of all I booked this on Priceline, I booked a room with a separate living space. It did not happen that way at checkin. WE WERE actually given a standard room.\n\nWe also called the hotel directly on May 10th, to verify the bedding would be hypo allergenic (no goose or down at all), I requested a fridge for a medical need, and a baby crib too. I was also promised a beech credit of 50. I recorded the call to verify all was ready to go.\n\nWe selected the M BAY for the pools, shark reef exhibit, and the it being on the end of the strip, with the boys. \n\nWhen we arrived it took one hour and thirty minutes to check in. No help with our bags. After the checking in the issues and more concerns piled up, only to not be resolved in a timely manor, or only after asking for the same item more than once. If it even was resolved at all.\n\n\nThe standard room, was dirty.\n1. Hair on bed and pillows.\n2. Toilet had number 2 stains in it.\n3. Snack tray was there, but item was open gross I am hoping no charge for that.\n4. Wrong bedding\n5. there was no way I was going to stay in the wrong room either.  I spoke to the main desk. who promised us help quickly. \nWe Waited for the agent we spoke to to come move us he did not?\n6. We called guest services again and then were told to hold by Rachel. She spoke To agent one and said he actually would not move us right away and that the wait was not too bad, and then stated the first agent had to get permission from the supervisor to help us. However he did not and was unable to call us back in the whole forty minutes we waited.\n3. All of a sudden the crib shows up, and he tries to put it in the room. Unfortunately that is when I called back to the desk, as we were moving rooms or so I thought. \n\nTHE SECOND ROOM WAS WORSE.\n1. The view was nice, but that's all.\n2. It was still the wrong room, as it had no king and no separate bed for the kids, no living space, and no baby crib, or fridge, \n3. Dirty headboard with white fluid on it? I have the pictures. The room smelled like smoke, and would have to wait for bedding to be changed. \n4. Called and spoke to The only assistant night manager, who was awful his name was TREA, (Trey).\n\nHE WANTED TO JUST HAVE US WAIT IN THE FILTH AND HAVE A MAID EVENTUALLY CLEAN THE ROOM. I WAS NOT ABLE TO ALLOW THAT WITH OUR  KIDS AND US. THE ROOM WAS REALLY NOT CLEAN AND WAS IN ITS OWN RIGHT A HEALTH HAZARD. WE WERE EVEN TOLD TO STORE MEDS IN MINI BAR.\n\n\nANOTHER ISSUE, we took our bags to the bell desk as the assistance never came to the room to help load them. I was so upset I ended up talking to TK as I refused to talk to TREA. He had us store our bags at the bell desk.We then had to leave our bags at the bell desk while again they tried to fix the room cleanliness issue, and get us into the correct the room. I brought down my iPad to guest services and showed TK the booking to make sure it would run smoothly. He said it would be correct and that the crib and fridge would be in the room and cold when we got back. The only thing is we would have to have call down for our luggage when we get back to the room later. All of this took at least another hour and a half if not more.\n\nROOM THREE - WORSE YET AFTER RETURNING AT TEN AT NIGHT, \nwe came back to the room only to be shocked by just a king bed. where does my older son sleep!  Where does the baby sleep. \n\n NO BABY CRIB NO FRIDGE. WE HAD JUST REPLACED THE MEDS FROM CVS.  Which one expensive fix. It was still the wrong room. I called down to guest services again, and was told they can't get another room right now, but could get us or correct room tomorrow. They left us in a jam and we were forced to take the room as is. Tub was dirty too. The baby crib did not show up after three calls and closer to midnight, and the rollaway bed that was promised for our older son never came. The fridge came before the baby crib at 11:39 PM. I was very upset at this point. \nAs soon as the baby bed came, everyone crashed. My poor husband in a chair as we did not have enough beds for us. A great way to spend his birthday trip sleeping, waiting and asking for help with issues. \n\nTHE FORTH ROOM, \nFINALY THE CORRECT ROOM, MY HUSBAND HIMSELF MOVED US IN WITH WHAT HE COULD CARRY AND WAITED FOR THE REST OF OUR LUGAGE TO ARRIVE. he waited forty minutes. The fridge never came, the baby bed had to asked about two times, but the room was right. Crappy view beyond what vegas should have, literally faces another wall, and when you look down there is a ton of pipes and bird poop. AGAIN I HAVE A PICTURE. \n\n\nHERE IS WHAT WE WRE PROVIDED\n\nCRAPPY FLOOR SERVICE WHILE AT THE CASINO, got one drink in two hours plus.\n\nA SHARK REEF VISIT ON THEM, AND a 100 dollar credit. We also requested a late check-out do to our super late check-in and all the room changes. \n\nIT IS NOT WORTH IT TO STAY HERE.

If you don't care about people parking your car, DO THE FREE VALET.  I drove my boat back there trying to find a parking space, and I couldn't find ONE space I felt comfortable leaving my car.  I ended up parking in the hotel parking lot next door and walked over after leaving the frustration known as Firefly's parking lot.\n\nI wanted the Firefly fries that I've grown to enjoy...They come with Parmesan, Herbs, and an Aioli for $6.  Since I knew I was gonna order another plate or two in addition to the fries, I decided just to spend the money for the steak and fries :P\n\n14oz Ribeye ($20): Red Wine Sauce, Cabrales Bleu Cheese, Firefly Fries and Aioli. Surprisingly large ribeye for the money! It was a good steak, cooked perfectly, but the sauce/seasoning was a little distracting. Still good though!\n\nHowever, the fries were undercooked and stupid oily.  Like \""dripping off your fingers\"" OILY.  I should have returned them, but my steak was cooked perfectly, and I thought it was a waste to turn over the plate.  They probably would have just brought me a new side of fries, but that's in hindsight. \n\nSo you can still get a decent value at Firefly...just factor in bad parking and a hint of inconsistency and you'll probably be fine!\n\nPics :",606875

It's just a middle class hotel, really, and if that's what you want and the Luxor is offering a good rate, then go for it. Just make sure to learn about the resort fee before you make your reservation.\n\nAs for my experience, the Luxor was clean but the shower drain was clogged, causing an overflow onto the bathroom floor. Our room had a view of the strip, although being on the south end of the strip, the view wasn't impressive at all. The sloped window was impressive for all of two seconds. Check-in was a breeze.

3,"After much research into finding a good buffet in Vegas, I found the Wicked Spoon. I had read some horror stories about other buffets, so I was pretty picky about where we ate on our first trip to Vegas. This buffet did not disappoint.\n\nFirst of all, it is expensive. $80 for two people, but that did include all you can eat and soft drinks. The buffet was the most high end I have ever been to. It had appetizers which included a variety of salads, a meat and cheese spread, shrimp cocktail and more. The main course dishes went on forever. Crab legs, bone marrow, lobster claws, mac and cheese bar, fried chicken, sweet potato mash, Korean short ribs, pizza, I could go on and on and on. My absolute favorite thing by far was the gnocchi. It was quite possibly the best gnocchi I have ever had, the sauce was fantastic, the gnocchi was perfect, soft and cooked to perfection. I would go back and only have that every single time. The dessert section also seemed to have an extraordinary amount of variety. Puddings, gelato, cake, pie, cheesecake, cookies, rice pudding, and my favorite, enormous chocolate covered strawberries dipped in Heath bar or Reese cups. Again, if all they served was gnocchi and those strawberries, I would pay for it time and time again.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, our server was great, she kept our table clear and our drinks full. It wasn't super busy when we were there, but I can imagine it would get a little crazy if it would be busier. I recommend an early dinner or late lunch because when we finished by 6:30p or so, people were pouring in. It's a place you must try, but you won't ever look at another buffet the same way!",492297
1,"Ok the whole point was to try some place new and we did. The booth was nice as we were able to watch the show on Fremont street. But the rest of the dinner was totally average.\nThe waiters seemed to have a little attitude. We waited 20 min before getting our drink order in and even then it was only cause we stopped the host to ask if we can order. We got asked about our meal when we were already done and had to ask twice for drink refills. He didn't seem friendly when we are a light hearted group.\nThe food was average. I got the tuna appetizer and it wasn't popping with flavor like ahi should be. The calamari the rest of the table got was like you can get anywhere, nothing special. For my main dish I got the crab stuffed shrimp, good not great. I like crab and shrimp so enjoyed but again the sauce and food wasn't popping with any flavor. The asparagus I could make at home. The sweet potato wedges were good but must have been a white sweet potato so not what I imagined and not sure I would have ordered. I don't tend to eat white potatoes. Lastly they brought cheesecake for the birthday, we aren't much into cheesecake but I'm told it was good. Now I love cobbler and have had some good ones based on my travels but their apple cobbler was bland to me. I don't know if it's the apples used or again the spices missing. \nI can say I have been there but doubt I would go again.",536155

We were initially sat in their back private room but there was not alot of air flow and the sun was heating the room through its large windows. The waitress was happy to move our party into the main room, much more comfortable. The room reminded me of my grandmothers house but with plastic lawn chairs for seating. Cute, random table clothes decorating the tables. Staff was friendly and attentive.\nThe boys in the group got sandwiches and ice tea or lemonade. The girls got \""High Tea\"". I got the Strawberry Tingler rooibos. It was probably the best tea I ever had. I started with the corn chowder, very tasty with lots of chunks of vegetables. The finger sandwiches were good, fresh made, I added a little bit of salt to enhance them, but I like salt. The tuna was probably my least favorite. I preferred the Chicken salad, egg salad, and cucumber sandwiches. The scones were offered in 3 different kinds...apricot was the best, the cherry sour cream cam in second, the coconut chocolate chip I thought would've been the best, but I was disappointed. The jam and cream they serve along side is a perfect accompaniment.\nIf your looking for a new experience, its an affordable treat.",422383
4,I love this place. My husband and I were able to share a meal because the portions are so big. The food is amazingly delicious.,55323
3,Very cool place to eat just outside of main Charlotte downtown area. I has the burnt ends and baked beans. Baked beans are AMAZING! 30 bucks for 2 people including an app. And you can smell it from the parking lot and shops nearby. My wife said the turkey sandwich is the best she ever had.,512257
4,"Love Tempe Marketplace, I prefer this Harkins over Cinemark. There's always nice people with great service and you're not waiting at concession for an oblivious worker to serve you and get in when your movie is starting like Cinemark. Also seems cheaper than Cinemark most days. Love the 3D they added! Love the seats, the food, the clean, everything. Can't beat it!",279224
3,"Margaritas were tasty but a little light on the booze.  Complementary chips and salsa were better than average.  Even though we didn't get any food the waiter still brought us a white chocolate with pecan mini tamale for desert at no charge.  Nice touch, just for that kind gesture I'll come back to eat.",13482

2,"Before eating at \""That's a Wrap\"" for the first time, I remember reading a few reviews that mentioned how filling the wraps were. I thought to myself, \""Ok, but that's probably for someone with a relatively small appetite.\"" Because, you see, I usually eat \""American\"" proportions, so I ordered the Thai wrap with the Lentil Soup.\n\nIt's not that I was eating incredibly fast, but I didn't realize how freaking full I was until about 30 minutes after I was finished with lunch. I was actually uncomfortable from being so full. I would like to emphasize again that this really doesn't happen very often for me. The food was good, nothing crazy-awesome, but good. I just wish I would have eaten A LOT less of it. That wrap could have easily fed two people. If I go again, I'll be splitting the wrap!",473467
3,"I should just stop calling these reviews part of my cider tour of the Phoenix area and seek sponsorship from Strongbow instead because it's the only draught they, being bars with an Irish theme, have other than the one blowing up my arse about these being Irish pubs that is.\n\nDon't worry by my second pint this review gets friendlier. \n\nLet's start with the appetizers and the curious price of curry and chips. $8.95.The price of the curry sauce and the chips ($2.50 and $4.00 when ordered separately)  is an application of new math that I find puzzling. *\n\nOk the first pint is warming me up and it's time to praise the banger wontons Nope it's not an Asian street gang but a dab of pork sausage and herbs within a wonton wrapper.  These are really good, pretty inventive and the spicy sauce that comes with them ( seems to be HP , Vinegar and something I can't quite put my  tongue on ( horseradish?)  , while good, is a little  overpowering for the center.  We really liked these.\n\nPint 2:\n\nMy wife had the beer battered fish and chips and loved them but she'll get to that in her review. I had the shepherd's pie boxty , basically ground lamb/ beef  wrapped up in a potato based crepe/ pancake.  The filling was light, moist and nicely spiced  unlike the usual attempts by most places to hide up a culinary crime scene. E.g If you can't do the thyme...  The accompanying veggies, asparagus and peppers were a nice touch and you can see the visual appeal of the dish on the accompanying picture. \n\nDesert. \n\nWe had. ok we ordered,  the Irish whiskey creme brulee , most of the desserts here are about as Irish as George Takei, and it was absent of any whiskey taste that either of us could discern.It's OK but a let down given the promise.    Knocking off .5 stars for that and the appetizer pricing. \n\nFood came out really quickly  in under 10 mins. It  was about 1430 when we came in and the place was kinda quiet. Mallory provided great service throughout.\n\n*I wrote their corp office and Eric returned an explanation within an hour. the disparity in the chip/curry conundrum lies with the curry sauce. The \""side\"" of sauce is supposed to be 3oz less than the appetizer.",376692

1,"To me Outback Steakhouse is on par with Applebee's or TGIFriday's - nothing special.\n\nThe food is okay, the atmosphere is okay, the service is okay. \n\nA friend of mine loves this place so the boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We all ordered steak. I ordered the outback special - a 6 oz steak with your choice of two sides - I chose fries and veggies. You get all this for $10. And guess what? It tastes like a $10 steak. I guess I've been spoiled at places like Mastro's and Morton's because this steak was not even in the same galaxy as steaks from those places. But it was $10 so I wasn't expecting it to be the best steak I've ever had either. Honestly, for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay. In retrospect I with I would have shelled out a few more bucks, maybe I would have gotten something a little better.\n\nAll in all, Outback isn't horrible, it's just not great. It's a chain and you get what you pay for.",48270
2,"It's not often I find myself on Murray Ave, but i was meeting a friend over at BRGR for lunch and took the long way. I was at a red light when I noticed a parking spot near this bakery. Not too often you can get a spot on Murray right near the place you're going to, so I took it as a sign.\n\nI'd been here before, the first time was late on a Sunday afternoon, when I walked in just about everything was sold out, I had my mouth watering for texas toast made with  Allegro's 12 grain whole wheat bread. Damn Like Seinfeld, someone ahead of me got the last loaf. I settled for a regular whole wheat. I really enjoyed it. \n\nThis time I was lucky and got the 12 grain I wanted. This bread is pretty amazing with lightly browned smoked tofu, charred arugula, peppered greek olives, and veganaise. No vegan restaurant makes a sandwich like that.(Thanks Deb! She's my dietician)\n\nI need to get my butt out of bed early one day and get up there when I have the entire bakery at my whim!",77420
2,"Oh, fuku burger. What a colorful and moody character you seem to be.\n\nAfter a night of shenanigans, the boy wanted a treat. Having spotted the illusive Fuku-truck on our way elsewhere, we hoped they'd still be there when we were done. Around 2 AM, they were, and had a big crowd of costumed fans gathering around. Descending upon the Bank of America parking lot, you can hear their music blasting; we arrived to a song about capping people and a chorus of gun-shots and the N-word. Kind of awkward, but whatever. It seems there's a lot of repeat customers or fans that hang around the truck, as there were people parked and hanging out by or in their cars for the entire duration we were there. \n\nThere was no sense of organization in the line, just a clusterf**k of people mobbing around the lone girl taking orders. We had several people attempt to get in front of us and others asking us where the line ended. Some people stood on the periphery of the cluster and waited for 10+ minutes in the cold in skimpy costumes before getting frustrated and leaving without anything.\n\nThe music was also so loud that it made ordering a challenge unless you got in the poor girl's face or yelled at her. She took our name and put our order in. When done a guy would scream out your name  from the window, vainly competing with the music. We watched him call for 4-5 people with visibly growing aggrivation. \n\nThe menu itself was pretty simple, though I know you can customize with eggs or extra patties. We opted for the Karai, or spicy burger, and an order of their garlic fries. We ate the fries on the drive home and had the burger once there. The fries seemed like they were from a box then heavily dosed with their garlic salt. I liked the sauces that came with them, but J thought they were too salty. The fries had decent crunch and heft- they weren't potato needles or massive steak fries.\n\nOnce we got to the burger, we were disappointed. The burger had flavor but was burnt on the outside and ultra-rare on the inside. Topped with a spicy mayo, another sauce, cucumber, avocado \""cream\"" and a couple of other toppings, it had an interesting combo of textures and flavors to compliment the meatiness, but not enough to save it from being mediocre. The burger may have been more redeemable if the experience/atmosphere of ordering it hadn't put us off. \n\nThe area around the truck was trashed with half eaten food and debris everywhere. Stickers and photos covered much of the windows and the only insights we had into the kitchen was the irritated guy sticking his head out and yelling at a \""mutha fuga'!\""to get back in the truck. \n\nThis is really an instance where the business philosophy shines at the forefront. Compare these fellows to the Slider truck; The boys there sing while cooking, happily greet their customers with enthusiasm & a fist bump, maintain a clean exterior and fairly consistent food preparation. I've had a mediocre slider and forgiven them because they were so pleasant to deal with. The food here has the potential for awesomeness but I just don't want to deal with a disorderly mob to get a burger. \n\nEDIT: Bumped a star for owner response :} It's always nice to see a business taking the time to respond to criticisms directly like that.",466081

I have been going now for almost 2 years and have been very happy every time. Final word, kudos to Tina. I have never known her to be anything but absolutely sweet. She is a real pro.",415322

3,"Okay, so I don't really have much to say about this place since I've only done the cafe/pastry service. But if that's just a taste of what the rest of restaurant is, then the restaurant is probably very very good.  Think buttery pastries that are always flaky and never greasy. My favorite is the smoked salmon croissant--creamy, just a bit salty, all encased in a wonderful flaky crust. Think fancy-ass Hot Pocket.\n\nA note about the drinks. DO NOT GET LEMONADE to go. EVER. I did that today, and it cost just a little less than my croissant. I was surprised to learn that my drink was 3.25, but then I went to their website and learned they do free lemonade refills. Which is great if you're eating in, but sucks if you're taking out.",85069

I am a huge fan of Latin cuisine so when I saw it was possible to get a three course meal for $39 I jumped at the chance.\n \nI chose the millionaire tacos as the entree which came with avocado and salsa and really enjoyed them. For the main I chose the eye fillet of beef and was pleasantly surprised at the size of beef served - it was great considering it was part of a three course meal. The beef was served with crab meat (not a fan), equadorian potato (delicious!), some peas and snow pea sprouts. Lastly the desert was just super delicious! I had a chocolate cigar and cappucino ice cream. \n\nMy friend and I sampled each others food and her entree and desert were really nice. Her main (chicken) was huge but wasn't as nice as her other courses. \n\nThe service was prompt and friendly, minus 1 star for the bland mojitos.",207071
3,"Friendly service and fresh ingredients are the stars here.  I tried the special for the day, battered cod with 2 sides.  Our waitress explained that the cod was a fresh filet and hand battered.  I had it with steamed vegetables and clam chowder.  The clam chowder was also freshly made, and had nice large chunks of clam in it.  The chowder itself tasted a little too salty for me though.  The green beans were freshly steamed green beans, and they were a nice deep green color vs. the greyish mushy green beans you might usually see at restaurants.  \n\nService was excellent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Our waitress was very warm and friendly.  Sunny's Diner is hopefully here to stay for many years!",561819

We were greeted from the door and seated immediately.\nWe started with couple of appetizers such as the infused game pate and grilled brie, and for main dish I ordered the steak with black pudding and my friend ordered the sauteed chicken in red pepper sauce.  Both of the dishes were well prepared. The steak and the black pudding just hit the spot. I also tried my friend's chicken and I loved that red pepper sauce.\nVeggies were a bit plain and maybe a little over cooked but the dinner was enjoyable and was fully completed with the great service we got from the woman working at the restaurant. I am not sure if she was the manager or not. But she was quite polite and helpful.\nI would love to come here in summer and dine out on the patio, it has such a nice and unique view...",354229

Just a note; we also have been buying furniture from a place that is going out of business (Furniture Marketplace on Westinghouse Blvd.).  How can we be recieving stellar service, from sales point to delivery, from a place that is going out of business, when this newly opened store who presumably is trying to build a book of clients can't deliver a furniture order until a month and a half after promised delivery?\n\nPass on this one...with all the great furniture shops in town and in west north carolina, why put up with this stuff?",528172

When i told him that i needed to leave he said ok we will put your tires back on and let you leave. I reminded him i had a flat tire and was riding on a spare.

Very cheap sake bombers. My husband likes the sushi rolls on happy hour. I'm not a fan of the vegetarian choices for happy hour. The sweet potato fries aren't very good. They don't have any veggie rolls on special for happy hour (c'mon veggies are cheaper than fish!) so I end up ordering my favorite roll, the veggie tempura roll, off the menu. It is always super tasty. The servers are sooo nice. They can be a little slow and forgetful when the restaurant is busy but they are too nice and genuine to get mad at them.\n\nThe bad\nAs I mentioned I usually order the veggie tempura roll for happy hour, even though it is not happy hour priced. Well, one roll isn't enough for me to get filled up so up to 2 months ago, I would order a side of PLAIN fried rice. Their fried rice is yummy. It was only about a cup full but it was perfect accompaniment to one veggie roll. Last time we went in for happy hour I tried ordering my usual veggie roll and SIDE of fried rice. The server looked at me with guilty eyes and said \""Oh, we can't do that anymore.\"" He said if I wanted to order fried rice I would have to order the $8 fried rice entree. The fried rice entree has an option of chicken or beef, which is probably why it is a whopping 8 bucks. I'm a vegetarian who just wants some damn fried rice without any meat but I am not going to pay $8 for just rice. The server said the manager put an end to the restaurant offering it as a side. Talk about nickel and diming! How cheap can you get? It's RICE! Apparently, the manager made a couple of other changes that the staff and patrons are not crazy about. \n\nUnfortunately, these small changes are making a huge impact on how often we will patronize Eastwinds.

Then, in the awesome bathroom, I dropped my hairbrush on the floor, and when I bent down to get it, there were 4 Xanax on the floor, under the vanity.  Neither of the above items were mine; we had just checked in.  I asked to change rooms and a room upgrade, and they told me that would be difficult.  They put an equal room on hold for me, but I couldn't get into it until 6pm the FOLLOWING day.   Really more of a hassle to move rooms.  Then, later in my stay, as I was walking from the shower to my room, I sliced the bottom of my foot open on a carpet staple/nail that was loose.  Hurts like hell.   Since I had already officially \""checked out\"" online early that morning, they wouldn't do anything about that.   For all of this, in a 48 hour stay, after talking with the management for a day and a half, they finally offered me a $100 credit on anything inside the hotel.  $100 does not buy 1 show ticket, or 1 spa treatment.  I still had to spend more money there.   I could not use $100 on food, since I was at a work conference. Some BS if you ask me.

Doesn't a restaurant want their customers to order one of the market price entrees? I guess not. \n\nWhile I was ordering, he seemed annoyed, snooty (lol, ok Mr. waiter) and rushed me while taking my order.

When we mentioned how long took and the problem, she apologized saying it was a bad night and try them another time.\n\nI don't think we will be back...",67205

2,"I have to agree with the other yelpers. I am a huge carnitas fan and the carnitas here are really good. They come with good basic rice and beans and fresh homemade tortillas, and the guacamole is fresh made and tasty. I really liked the chips, salsa, and the bean dip served at the beginning. The shredded beef tacos are good too.\n\nSome of the other things are a miss....the chimichangas are bad...from the shrimp and the chicken they are just bland.\n\nService is good and our server pepe was great.\n\nI would go again...although I think san francisco has better mexican food.",305093
1,"Originally, I was in love with this place. I have lived here going on my 5th month. In the beginning, they were generous and extremely satisfactory. Now that I've actually been through hell with them, my opinion has completely changed. When they went to go deposit a check I had written to them, they ended up getting all screwed up in the office and deposited two checks (one post-dated for a few weeks following) - This withdrew my account and I ended up speaking to the property manager and everything seemed handled, right? I think not. I go in to pay my rent and its an extra $70+ dollars added to my account. MY question -Why?! According to the property manager, who of course just had to intervene, the account charges were only covered to a point... SO, you're trying to tell me that because of your mistake I have to pay EVEN MORE? Excuse me, but that is not my error nor am I at fault. Then, she had the nerve to tell me to \""check\"" my attitude - all the while she was giving me attitude. WELL, if that is the way you want to treat your residents who can, for example, just go and log onto Yelp! and write of all the horrid experiences they have, they go right on ahead. The secondary problem I have with this place is that I was sent a check in the mail to cover my tuition and \""the new post office guy\"" checked it in twice as delivered, and its NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. Again, Miss Property Manager just said \""It is not my problem.\"" and \""You are the third person who has come to me with this issue.\"" How am I supposed to feel comfortable about receiving confidential and pertinent mail? \n\nI hate writing all this bad things about Lakeview because, really, I love my 2bd/2ba apartment, I love the pool and the complex is absolutely beautiful! But I have been left with no choice at this point! I am so aggravated and disgusted about the way I have been treated. And my real issue is that NO ONE is going to do anything about it!",114563
2,"Definitely competitively priced. Communication is not their strong point. I scheduled a move and called back a bunch of times, leaving unreturned messages to ensure it was scheduled and that they had received my signed contract. They were about 1.5hr late for the move (\""staffing issues\"") and I was somewhat turned off by the comment \""you don't have to tip us but if you do make sure you give it to us each, I don't trust __[another of the movers]__.\"" Mind you that person had clipped $10 bills to his shirt to show that he accepted gratuity \n\nThat being said, the move was very quick and relatively painless once they got to work. One of the movers, Rodney, definitely knew what he was doing and instructed the others on how to carry items properly. Luckily, he did the packing of the breakable items as well and was very careful to wrap items numerous times.\n\nThey bring their own moving blankets and I appreciated how they wrapped the couches and mattresses with saran wrap to prevent damage, it seemed to help.\n\nSo, other than the sketchiness as above, the move ended up going fine with minimal damage to the walls and items (definitely a plus). Would I go with them again? Yes, if I could ensure that they had a crew with at least a few people who had moved before",560237

She'd been considering buying a treadmill, too, so she chose one to try out and found that it was \""locked\"".

After trying it and thanking him, he then told her to \""come back when she was ready to buy\"", in an \""I'm not taking you seriously\"" kind of manner. Not once was he the least bit friendly or did he even crack a smile. That is the last time we will visit that particular store.

4,"Five stars! As good as it gets! \n\nI don't want to get THAT into it but I ran over my tow truck driver's foot. \n\nWell, I guess I will get into it. \n\nSo my car craps out on me. Lots of miles, lots of memories. Sure it is just an inanimate object. But this thing is so close to have been in all fifty states. Yes, ALL fifty (including Hawai'i). \n\nI digress. \n\nSo it is on on off-ramp of the 215. Disabled. I might or might not have checked in to CR-215 right before she broke down (a BIG fuck you to all the 'checking-in to beltways and parks and landmarks is pointless' crowd). \n\nAnyway, driver shows up. Gets the nifty ramp on his truck lowered and directs me to take the emergency brake off. Well, I do as told but must say that I do not keep my shift in gear. There are people that do and people who don't. I don't. What is the point? I always use the emergency brake. Fuck off, stop judging me. \n\nSo the car rolls. Fast. We are trying to stop it. Not working. Car suddenly stops. \n\nI get inside and pull the brake again. Driver, Cameron (?), points at his leg which is caught from the above the ankle down underneath my back tire. Car stopped suddenly because he used his foot like one uses a door stop, except on a car not a door and he used flesh and not rubbermaid\u00ae. \n\nFucking aye. \n\nCameron, or whatever his westernized name was, is Iraqi-American. We talked the whole way to the mechanic shop. Hardcore, albeit very kind and thoughtful, dude. \n\n777 Towing was just who USAA called up for my roadside assistance.

They weren't rude or anything, just not inviting y'know? Anyways I was craving a Taro Smoothie with boba so thats what I got. It was done very quickly, however upon drinking I wasn't too impressed.

0,"I moved to NW LV 6 months ago and often bike 20+ miles to the strip for some poker and gaming fun. I recently arrived at the Quad to meet a friend passing through town. Upon arriving I had to lock up my bike so I asked valet if they had a bike rack. The attendant replied with uncertainty and told me \""no\"", then said \""maybe in the back\"" and then \""no\"" again. I asked the attendant specifically if there would be a problem if I locked my bike up to a post or railing somewhere. The attendant didn't know or didn't think it would be a problem. I was very sure to show the attendant my concern for locking my bike to an undesignated post but it felt okay to do so according to the response. I proceed through the valet and into the parking garage to first look for a designated bike rack or bike area. After climbing several floors I came across nothing to be designated and proceeded to look for a railing. I came across an old and obviously unused stairway and locked up my bike using a Kryptonite lock and cable to the side of the staircase. I positioned my bicycle in a very thoughtful manner to make sure my handlebars or any extremity were in no way going to block the access of the staircase. I met a friend, we joined a poker tournament and I left roughly 2 hours later. My bike was gone. No evidence of anything was left behind. Immediately it felt like a security issue vs a theft issue. It takes a lot of work to break a Kryptonite U-Lock. I was outraged but I kept my cool and expressed my disgust professionally. \nValet called up security and immediately security became sarcastic and admitted they cut my lock and took my bike because it was illegally locked to a stairway. I then quickly began to explain how I spoke with valet about the bike rack situation and how there was no concern with locking my bike to a post or railing somewhere. Of course they didn't care and had very foolish reasons why they did what they did.  They told me that I should have asked security where to park my bike and not valet, but who would ever think to ask security? Valet seems like the more obvious to me. The security continued to tell me that if I would have asked them, they would have directed me towards the Bell desk and Bell would have taken care of it for me. Who would have thought Bell will take care of your bikes for you? And why aren't the valet trained to tell you that? \n\nI demand an apology and a $25 check to cover the cost of my lock. I will not let this go until I get what I deserve but either way this casino and Caesars Management in general have lost all my respect.",632872

0,"The Food Truck Festival was awful I wish got my time and money back.  I should up around 6:00 pm and the parking lot was packed.

The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was amazing, but I would rather deal with the crazy people scavenging for samples at Costco. We left earlier than we expected since most of the lines were fifty deep and headed to Postinos and had an amazing dinner. I rather go check out the good trucks in a different setting. Good Concept though.",531561
1,Stumbled across this restaurant with a friend visiting in and decided to take a chance with it and do I regret making that choice.\n\nWhen we went in it looked busy and took a while for them to stay us but then we were led into the other dining area which was nearly empty (only about three or for people exited from here when we entered). \n\nI ordered the chicken pad Thai and all three of us got a mango smoothie. When the food came my chicken in the pad Thai was tough and dry although the noodles were okay. When or drinks came they gave my friend a cup that was filled 75% compared to mine. When my friend complained they said it was because it was all that was left in the blender after pouring the previous two. Could they not have bothered to put in the effort to make a bit more so it didn't look as bad? It really wasn't that busy.... Service was bad to begin with as well and slow. \n\nNerve coming here again.\n\nOverall two stars both for service and quality of food.,518429

The food here is actually quite good - I've had their build it yourself burger (which was yummy and filling) and the chicken strips. Gotta say the chicken strips were less than impressive, but I did like the burger. The beer is good too, and they have good drink specials during karaoke. Thursday is ladies' night too, so having a vagina definitely helps there.\n\nSpeaking of karaoke - I love coming down here for Karate Karaoke.

1,"Proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  But take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.\n\nThe rolls at Mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  The fish is also not every good quality.  Want to avoid the rice?  You can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  Don't.  It is the worst pieces of fish I've ever had.  Also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  Many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  Probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.\n\nHaving said all that, I really wasn't surprised.  What was I expecting when I was paying so little?  But what really got me down was the service.  The staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  I was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  We figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  We figured wrong.  They brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray.  With some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  We then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  The server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.  Thanks for listening to a simple request.\n\nOne thing that was pretty fun about Mido was the music and lights that play when there was a birthday.  Once I finally figured out what was going on, it was a lot of fun.  Way better than an annoying birthday song by the staff.",311669

I'm not a big fan of steak houses but thought Cut would be different.  For the record, I didn't order the $28 an ounce kobe, I did order a dry aged new york sirloin.  It was a big piece of meat and that's what it was.  It was dry, flavorless, and very average.  I just wasn't impressed.  The wasabi-yuzu sauce was a nice compliment for the steak since it gave it some flavor.   For appetizer, I had heirloom tomato salad which I again thought was very average.  The salad was $21 and the steak was $59 and I don't think it was worth it.  For that same price, I could have ate somewhere else and probably had a tasting menu of some sort.  There wasn't anything spectacular about the meal, it just felt like over priced steak and salad.  \n\nThe service was relatively good, they were attentive and courteous.  The decor was somewhat depressing.  Perhaps they were going for the dim lighting of a steakhouse which is fine but I felt it didn't go well with the chairs and tables.\n\nThere were three of us and the bill was $336.

The lamb was good too- i'm not a big fan of lamb, but this was really tasty. \n\nTraditional hot tea can be had for a mere fifty cents, but I advise you ask them not to sweeten it if you're a purist.
