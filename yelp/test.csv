3,Its not a very helpful place but It was clean. It feels old and outdated. I did manage to meet good people that helped me get to my location. For service Im okay if the place doesn't look good.,29178
3,"After the drive up from Phoenix for March Madness . . . I decided to stop for lunch before heading to the hotel . . . and I am glad I did.\n\nThough this place is located in a seeder part of Las Vegas . . . I was surprized at how clean it was both inside and outside . . . and how friendly the staff was.\n\nI ordered a double cheese burger, chili cheese fries, and a medium coke . . . the soda was your typical self-service soda bar with free refills . . . the chili cheese fries were hot and crispy, but I would have preferred a something other a cheese slice for the cheese . . . the burger was very tasty, but the beef patties were overdone and dry.\n\nMy biggest surprize was the chili . . . it had a great flavor and had just the right amount of spices that it did not over-power the rest of the meal.\n\nWill I be back . . . YES . . . but not this trip . . . too many other spots to check out and try this trip.",360024
3,"Unlike my boyfriend Darren W, I'm not much of a burger fanatic, so when we came here last night, I tried their bbq chicken, and thought it was very good. Very moist and sweet. Also, as a side, I had the broccoli which was perfectly steamed. The service was awesome, and the place has an old-time charm to it. It worked for me. They have no desserts, but I guess that's what Oh! Yogurt's for. :)",3537
0,"The one at Alexis Nihon is really the worst. \nThe shelves are half empty, they wanted to put so many different departments that all of them are incomplete. Women's and men's clothes are disappointing. Nonetheless, I took 2 pieces to try on. At the changing rooms, the 2 teenagers were hidden behind a few piles of unfolded clothes and took a while before they saw me. They pointed the way to the room and it was a MESS ! The tiny hallway was cluttered with stuff and clothes and the room as well ! At least 15 pieces were hanging and on the floor with a bunch of broken hangers. I had no where to put the clothes so I just left without trying anything on. A man that seemed to be a manager there was yipping and yapping super loud all over the place and the shopping carts are just carelessly anywhere in the entrance blocking the access. Yes, customers leave them anywhere because that's what lazy people do but no one seemed to have picked them up since the start of the shift. Anyway... It's a free for all and Walmart looks high end compared to Target Alexis Nihon.",625413
3,"I have no idea what this place is like at night, or during the weekday lunch rush, but for lunch on a Saturday...it's perfect.  Not very busy, so its easy to get a spot at the small bar, or about any table you would want.  I prefer to sit at the bar during the day.  It's also the best way to get to know a new spot.\n\nTacos are great, but the pernil asada tacos are excellent.  Chips and salsa are fresh and the salsa has a nice kick.\n\nHighly reccomend the jalepeno infused margarita.  Amazing how many truly awful margaritas are available in the valley, but they do them very well here.\n\nPrices are more than reasonable and the happy hour prices are great.\n\nHopefully this place can be the start of bringing back The Esplanade.",485401
0,Great view of the Bellagio fountains. Food and service was a total missed.,313833
4,"So I have visited this place several times in between my first review and this review and they have managed to keep their 5 star rating. Tonight was the epitome of it all! I could not believe how delicious my meal was. I did finally try a new sauce: Kung Pao, so I don't know if that was it or not but everything was cooked to perfection. It was the busiest I have ever seen the restaurant too. \n\nThe staff, which was clearly under a lot of pressure, did not compromise their customer service at all. There was a woman helping out the chefs who was extremely courteous and would help you out with whatever you want. She kept the line moving and was very efficient. The chefs were also really nice! My mom has a food allergy. When you mention you have a food allergy they clean the entire cook top and get new utensils. Most places have an attitude because it's extra work for them. Not this place, they were very nice and were able to accommodate my mom's request. Even when she asked for the food to be cooked well done with not a lot of water, the chef said \""sure\"" and made her food to perfection. \n\nLove this place!",199227
1,"Die Franchise-Kette Purino ist nun auch in Karlsruhe am Gottesauer Schlo\u00df vertreten. Bereits zwei Mal konnte ich das Essen testen. Einmal hatte ich eine Pizza (Amici), heute dann die Nudeln (Fussili Arrabiata).\nBeides Mal kann ich die guten Bewertungen hier nicht nachvollziehen. Die Pizza schmeckt langweilig, fad und der Teig ist an den R\u00e4ndern so kross, da\u00df die Teigsplitter beim Gabelansetzen \u00fcber den Tisch fliegen. Die Nudeln habe ich heute sogar zur\u00fcckgehen lassen, weil sie wirklich nach gar nichts (!) geschmeckt haben. Es war wie Nudeln ohne alles, nur ein bi\u00dfchen rot eingef\u00e4rbt. Ich habe mir dann mit einem Kollegen dessen Pizza geteilt und da wurde \u00fcbrigens mein Eindruck von meinem ersten Besuch best\u00e4tigt; wieder langweilig und ohne besonderen Geschmack.\n\nKlar erwarte ich bei so einem System-Restaurant keine kulinarischen Hochleistungen, aber das war wirklich nichts. \n\nZus\u00e4tzlich negativ aufgefallen ist, da\u00df fast alle Messer und Gabeln, wenn nicht schmutzig, zumindestens unsch\u00f6ne Sp\u00fclspuren hatten. Kurz mal das Besteck anschauen, bevor man es in die kleinen Holzkistchen am Tischrand legt, w\u00fcrde sicherlich nicht schaden.\n\nEinen Stern gibt's f\u00fcr die nette Location und das Ambiente, den zweiten f\u00fcr den netten, freundlichen und verst\u00e4ndnisvollen Service. Meine Nudeln wurden ohne Murren zur\u00fcckgenommen und storniert und nach unseren Kritik\u00e4u\u00dferungen gab's dann noch einen Espresso (die Bedienung meinte EXpresso) gratis.",626424
1,"I'm not one to write reviews, I figure if I frequent enough it should always be the same or maybe better, not in this case.

0,"They don't deserve to use the words \""dim sum\"" in their name!!  This is not a dim sum place at all!!  A few dim sum items under the appetizer section of their menu does not do it!!  Who ever heard of $18 for a bowl of pho?!!  We didn't order that but wanted to note how ridiculous that was - only in Vegas, I guess!!  We had their wonton noodle soup, which was $12, and not spectacular!  We ordered the hau gow and sue mai just to try it and it was dry and not worth it at all!!  The service was super slow and the servers all looked miserable!  Worse place ever, not worth a dime!!!",329447
1,"We stayed at Paris in April for 7 nights.  The room and restaurants are great.  Prices are reasonable.  The housekeeping staff is wonderful, never had an issue.  On our 5th night we were dismayed that the guests in the room next to us were smoking an \""illegal substance\"" and the aroma/smoke was coming into our room.  I've never had this problem in any other hotel stay and had to complain.  We explanined that we are drug tested by our employer and it was a problem.  It was 11 pm and the only solution they had was to move us!!  We had to pack up all of our belongings and relocate.  They wouldn't ask our neighbors to cease their behavior.  When we complained the next day about the inconvience the front desk told us to fill out a comment card.  I've never been so disregarded!!!!!",161991
3,"FIrst off, I will definitely be back. The location is a little sketchy, but nothing terrible. They do have a little dinning room that seemed to fill up quickly. I went there primarily for the pizza and the pizza was delicious. We did not get the deep dish. We didn't have enough time to wait. However, I will be back to try the deep dish. The thin crust that we ordered was delicious. \n\nThe only reason I take a star off is for the wings. They were terrible. I ate one and could not stomach anymore. The chicken tasted old or rotten. But again, that's not their specialty. Next time I will stick to just pizza.",115655
1,I'm not saying this to be mean but what my inexperienced waitress did to me was comical and not excusable. I DO NOTE I am NOT basing my review on what she did and only the food but I feel it needs to be told so you see the whole picture.\n\nShe took our order and soon came to deliver the drinks . Her tray had three beverages a water an iced tea and a soda. Somehow she sorts of looses her balance and almost lost the water and it spills ON ME with Iced cubes hitting me but she manages to save it before it all splashes me. She said she was sorry but she suggested to ME TO CLEAN THE TABLE WITH THE PAPER TOWEL MYSELF! It's bad enough that she couldn't be bothered to clean that up but what really made it WORST was she left the wet napkin on the table the whole time we were dining. I do note she was very youthful and might have been only 15 or 16 years old so I have to chalk it up to that but I also note the cooks on the night I was here were also very youthful looking and I might not have experienced the food as it was meant to be prepared.\n\nWe started out with very average house salads and fried pickles appetizer. The salads seemed fresh and the dressing seemed bottled tasting and not so good. I thought the pickle appetizer was inedible not because of them being wet laden with oil but because of how overly salted they were. My husband who tolerates more salt than me didn't think inedible but he felt too that they were over salted and he ate only a few.\n\nOur two plates arrive and my husband got nearly everything they make on his plate and asked me to try stuff I didn't have. I only tried his short rib and had to stop there because it was DRY and almost cold. (YUK!) so then I moved on to my plate. I tried the BBQ'd Turkey first. It was almost good with good flavors and not too much sauce. I also liked that the sauce wasn't too sweet but like the Rib it was dry and almost cold. (YUK! again) So I figure maybe the chicken is good but I was WRONG again. (YUK!) Another almost COLD and VERY DRY. I really hate dry chicken. I had a nice looking side of vegetables but sadly they were ruined by a generous hand of BUDGET SEASONING SALT that tasted awful. Lastly I was hoping the corn bread would be ok but I WAS WRONG AGAIN and SADLY it was so dry and so from the box tasting even soaking it in honey butter couldn't fix it.\n\nI do note my husband said the store purchased hot link wasn't as dry as the BBQ'd other items. He also said the pork ribs were better than the beef rib. I also need to say  I hope that the day time crew prepares the food in the way the owner meant it to be. I say that because of the numerous BBQ awards they've earned that I saw here while dining. But.......\n\n\nOnly one word.......... \n\nPITIFUL,52564
0,"Sbarro... How you disappoint me! So I go to Sbarro after walking the strip in Vegas, and oh man does pizza sound good. We walk in and see the jacked up price, $9.99 for a slice and breadsticks. I got pepperoni and sausage an it tasted like cardboard, and felt like it as well. Also, if it says \""breadsticks\"" on the menu, usually this means more than 1. But I guess at this Sbarro it means only 1, no arguing! All in all very disappointed!",359952
4,"First - A few things I think we can all agree on about the Fry Bread House (East)\n\nYes its kind of a hole.\nYes they are stingy with their soda (50 cent refills... really?)\nYes their staff can be a little....  independent\n\nNow something folks might disagree on about the Fry Bread House (East):\nThey serve the best fry bread on earth and deserves a 5 star rating even if they decide that folks in line need to be regularly beaten.\n\nI've had fry bread from all over this state.  You can get it at the state fair, various restaurants, roadside stalls, a yellow school-bus in the parking lot of Mazatzal casino, there's even a guy in mesa who sells it out of his driveway.  None of it compares to what they sell here - its just stunningly good.\n\nGet a \""Taco\""  for lunch and then get a sweet one for desert - you can buy em both at the same time they'll toss the desert one in whenever you ask.",414392
2,"I liked the Gelato Spot, although its not the best gelato that I have had but its not that bad either. Also the nickname of 'the G spot' kinda grosses me out. The decor/design of the place is way cool, the staff seems to think they are to good to be serving others, but whatever. I recomend this place if you are in the area but not worth any kinda trek.",229262
4,"I've been to may steak houses in many cities, usually ordering a NY Sirloin. But I've never had a steak as good as I did at Botero this past week. I ordered it rare/med rare and it was done perfectly. Warm red inside with a seared exterior, perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper. The size was very generous and it was well trimmed. I just had a side of mushrooms that was enough for 2 or 3. If there was one complaint, wine by the glass was limited with just one Cabernet at $25. Other red wines were under $20.",366207
3,"I'm so excited this place is here!  We just relocated to the area and are so relieved Starbucks isn't an option anymore!

We shared a roasted turkey, bacon, and cheese sandwich on ciabatta...it was very good.",229715
3,"Tried Bombay Spice last night. After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts!\n\nIt was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!). \n\n Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations. \n\nWe ordered:\nSomosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty).\nNaan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum)\nGrilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).\n\nWe each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. \n\nI ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).\n\nHusband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home. \n\nNext time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things. \n\n$35 before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. We'll definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us.",320246
2,"So here's the deal... if you want a motel quality room, in a prime location, and a cheap (for vegas) price... then this place may just work for you.\n\nHubby and I stayed here for our Couple's shower because we could get a suite for $100 a night. While the room wasn't anything special, it was decent. The whole room was huge, there were mirrors over the bed (classy!), and it had the craziest shower/bath I had ever scene! The whole thing was surrounded by mirrors and glass. When it got fogged over it was a bit like something out of some scary movie however. Oh, and you have to be 5ft tall or shorter if you want to take a shower. Unless you don't mind knelling in the tub. But, they kept the room clean and it was in a great location.\n\nRoom service was decent. However, I wouldn't waste money eating anywhere else in the hotel. Not a good food selection. The casino is well equipped with a variety of slot machines, which is nice for the slot machine junkies (like myself). The car show is worth seeing and pretty reasonably priced. Definitely something I would do again.\n\nI wouldn't recommend staying in the expansion on the back. A couple of my girlfriends stayed back there, and had to be escorted to their room by one of the guys every night. You know it's a bad location when you can smell the drugs walking through the halls and see a naked man running out of his room while arguing with his wife/girlfriend.\n\nOverall, an ok place if you are traveling on a budget. Just go elsewhere to eat and avoid the expansion!",166851
2,"The food is good, fun atmosphere, attentive wait staff. The wife and I tried a pound of crawfish as well as a pound of shrimp. Delicious. The sweet potato fries were crisp, the calamari a bit bland.\n\nI get IT, I just don't like IT. I do not enjoy working this hard to feed myself. I do not enjoy how dirty/greasy one gets. I have done this once, I'm good, never again.",272667

I wish we could have gone to the Chandelier bar but we were \""busy\"" napping and laying by the pool.\n\nOur room was gorgeous, had a view of the fountains, Paris balloon and Eiffel tower.  And they were able to accommodate us by giving us 2 adjoining rooms.  Only downsides were value for money (but probably good bc it may be deterring the trashiest) and the fact that we were in a wheelchair accessible room with no lip on the shower which made for some flooding.  Nothing that couldn't be fixed with a few towels.\n\nThe BLVD pool is amazing too.  Would LOVE to see a show here.",435840

0,"We just moved in together after my Girlfriend/fiance lived here for over a year. She said it they used to care about their customers. \n\nManagement knew you by name, issues were resolved, and the grounds were well kept. \n\nWe have been here since Mid May 2012 and have had nothing but issues with the staff, and requests for repairs. The Repair staff is phenominal. The process to get the simplest request done takes 2-3 times as long usually due to management dropping the ball.\n\nWe made a payment on time through their system and it not only posted late we got to pay an additional 100 bucks in fees, which the office would not bother crediting even though it was their error. There bill pay switched over and after speaking directly with their systems operator/company they verified it was their error. But we were still out an extra 100. \n\nWe were up front with them about two pets moving in. We told them we would not renew if our pets weren't allowed. We were told by management everything was fine. Two months into the lease and only after we were attacked by a neighbors dog, my hand and my smaller dogs face, resolved, not on the leash and not even listed on the property, we received a notice of unauthorized dogs on the property. After confronting the office it turns out they messed up but we now get to pay an additional 51 a month. Even though according to our agreement that cost is already factored in... \n\nNeedless to say after numerous headaches with the office staff having very poor customer service, after ripping us off, we are now seeking legal action to garner back our costs spent and have also contacted The Better Business Bureau. \n\nI would not recommend this property to anyone. The cabinets are cheap, the appliances in the kitchen were new, the dryer and washer were old. Stains on carpet when we moved in and after requesting a price to replace we were quoted over 900 dollars out of pocket to replace carpet we were renting. \n\nThe grounds are well kept, and the community is really sketchy, I have seen a man pummel a women and after I threatened him to lay off her he just flat out said \""I don't care, seems to be the slogan of the Broadstone Ahwatukee Fairways. We went from a rent of about 845 a month to now almost 1000 a month and due to poor insulation about 200 in electric a month in SRP bills. \n\nThere are better apartments and I highly recommend you keep looking. 700-900 in Ahwatukee can find you a lot better.",480535
2,"The experience of coming to Sandbar was decent but i don't think i would go again.  The service was the most disappointing aspect of it for me. To be fair they were very busy and I understand that but it was one disappointing aspect to the service tol many. To start off we didn't have menus for a good while after we got here. When our food did arrive finally i was left silverware-less for longer then I wanted to be when I was hungry from waiting for a good while earlier to even get my order in.  I had shredded beef enchiladas that were actually not bad. Not the best I've ever had but they were better than others as well with good black beans and rice as well.  \n\nMy friend had fish tacos, and this part of my review is hearsay admittedly, but he didn't like them too much. He could tell that they had used frozen mahi. If you have fish that's been frozen you're not going to have a good time. Truth. \n\nSo while I had food that was good enough my overall experience did not merit a return visit.",477312

1,"Before I jump into my review I want to say that this place isn't necessarily \""Meh\"" for everyone. I've had many a massage for varying prices and quality, so based on that is why this place gets 2-stars.  I picked this place to go based on the reviews, but I guess I have a more picky palette when it comes to people touching me.\n\nCOST - Yes, this place is probably the cheapest and more decent for the price for a regular massage. But, I've had massages for about the same price in Hawaii that was better (And Hawaii is expensive as hell, like Las Vegas). I paid $89 for a 90 minutes massage.  It's a decent price I think, but just comparatively, I've had better for close to the same cost, if not cheaper.\n\nMASSAGE EXPERIENCE - Maybe I'm jaded or have been getting massages wrong for the past couple years, but usually when I get I massage they start with my back since usually there is the most tension there is probably requires the most attention, but what do I know? I'm not a massage therapist, but what I can say is that everything else was done first and my back last.  That's not something I'm use to and whether or not that is normal is for a pro to determine, but what I can say is that I feel like my back needed a lot more attention.  Also my neck needed a lot more attention, as I type this my neck hurts. That was one of the first things worked on, which I usually like ending with that.  I could mention many other things about my massage experience that had me unimpressed, but the order of things was a major one.\n\nAMBIANCE - The room itself was great. No complaints here.  Probably one of the better rooms I've had a massage in. As for the building, it was in the midst of renovations, which I can't complain about, but it just made the place look shady.\n\nPAYMENTS???? - Okay, so I made my appointment online, which I think is weird because if I don't know anything about massages, how am I to know what \""type\"" is best for my ailments?  Not only that, but they missed an opportunity to get me to spend more money, but because I did not understand their ordering system I just bought whatever massage I was familiar with.  I would've totally done more, but there was no customer service to sell me on more.  Not only was I peeved about that, but I had to pay for my appointment before I even got massaged.  That is ODD. Who does that? But I paid for it anyway.  I was peeved again that I could not add a tip to my payment, so I had to go withdraw cash before I came in and I did not know the neighborhood.\n\nOVERALL - Meh, seriously, but I'm basing this off the fact that I've been to many a massage therapist.  I'm a bit of a snob and usually when I find someone good I stay with that person, but I have yet to find someone in Las Vegas for me. :(",72485
3,"A must try just for the atmosphere! My husband and I, I would say, have just aged-out of the target demographic of this place. We actually brought our baby (as I said, just aged-out, so new baby must come along on vacations) and it was super chill. While there was no sitting inside, the outside was a lovely Phoenix evening with a lovely crowd of folks. \n\nWe tried out pastries and coffee drinks. The pastries--Red Velvet Cake and Lemon Bar--I wanted to love because they came on adorable mismatching china, but at that late hour they had unfortunately staled. \n\nBut the coffee! I had a decaf Americano and it was maybe the best coffee I've ever had. And to be honest, decaf is never good. It's just something to sip on whole others have a cocktail. This decaf, though...\n\nMy husband waited in the epic cocktail line (separate from the food/coffee drink line) and asked the bartender to surprise him with something coffee-based. He was served some kind of masterpiece of spirits and freshly-pulled espresso, complete with thoughtful aromatic garnishes. Again, rocking coffee.",152187
0,"so very disappointed. bellagio used to be one of my favorite vegas buffets, and now it has been reduced to the worst on my list.\n\nthe variety was simply lacking. and worst of all, the quality was abysmal. there was nothing that i wanted to eat, and everything that i did eat was sub-par at best. i was stunned at the fact that the carving station only offers medium or well-done prime rib. it was far too overcooked for my taste, and the carver was rude and unskilled. after asking multiple times to slice the prime rib thinly, he continued to carve 2 inch thick slices to patrons. everyone was frustrated with the carver, his rudeness, and just the appalling waste of food because he was incapable of slicing anything less than a size of a brick.\n\nanother shocking discovery was the installation of soft serve machines and the disappearance of hand scooped gelato. this utterly disgusted me and was the final nail in the coffin. who the hell wants drippy icy ooze that melts the minute it hits the bowl? it was worse than the local sizzler.\n\nand there is an average wait of 45 minutes for this atrocity? no thanks.",178112

Then you have to walkthru their rooms on the 4th floor to the spa, that's where the cafe is, in the spa.\n\nAs if that's not ingenious itself, there's no wait service.  You order at the counter and wait for the food to be brought over.  They're understaffed, I even over heard them say so, so expect to wait to put your order in and wait some more for the overpriced food.  Oh yea, we ordered 2 breakfast sandwitches and 2 coffees for $40.\n\nThe portion is tiny, don't expect to get full but you can expect the feeling of being ripped off, bigtime...  We saw 3 ppl sit down and walked right out.  We should have followed.\n\nI would recommend this place only for those staying in the hotel, want something extra light and don't mind spending alot of money.",174422

We were greeted from the door and seated immediately.\nWe started with couple of appetizers such as the infused game pate and grilled brie, and for main dish I ordered the steak with black pudding and my friend ordered the sauteed chicken in red pepper sauce.  Both of the dishes were well prepared. The steak and the black pudding just hit the spot. I also tried my friend's chicken and I loved that red pepper sauce.\nVeggies were a bit plain and maybe a little over cooked but the dinner was enjoyable and was fully completed with the great service we got from the woman working at the restaurant.

I admire the stamina, strength and willingness of the performers to put on a great show, despite a couple boo-boo's.  The main issue are the cultural differences with the audience.  During the performance the performers begin sort of a chant-cadence with clapping hands...Now, I'm not Steve Martin in \""The Jerk\""...I can get my groov on...but they would keep changing it up and then frown at the audience for screwing up.

I was excited that you could get your chicken tossed in any sauce so I just got hot and said wanted ranch dressing and nachos.  The salad was bigger than I was expecting.  I was disappointed in the tossed chicken.  It looked like they just poured hot sauce on top of my salad because I it was everywhere on top.  Then as I was mixing it up the bottom was all watery.

No complaints just super full bellies and an awkward waddle out the door. We had a 45 minute wait to be seated for a party of 5 but we just headed to O'Shea's downstairs to pass the time.

1,"Went to Villalpando's with some friends because they like this restaurant.  I had no idea where it was, until we got there.  It's located at Chandler Blvd just east of I-10.  Years ago, it was a sports bar filled with TV's, but they are long gone.  I don't eat anything green (except peas), so finding something to eat there was a chore.  I normally have a red chili beef burrito when I go to a Mexican restaurant, but they only had green chili.  I ended up eating a bean and cheese burrito, which was very good.\n\nI agree with the other reviews of this place... it's not bad, but not great. I'm sure my friends would disagree.  They love it.  The prices are fantastic.  For the beer drinkers, no beer on tap.  Only bottles.  Unlike the sports bar, I hope they survive, because the place was dead on a Friday night.",327249

Ordered items missed and/or served under or over cooked, no checking on drinks, and no quality checks.  Just like the Eiffel Tower restaurant in this hotel, this establishment goes in the \""poser\"" category - a place with the facade of a high-end food experience with the reality of an Applebees. \n\nI discussed the evening with the shift manager...she took the automatic 18% tip off of the bill then told us that we \""were only hurting the servers\"" (out of guilt, we tipped back about 10%).  So to sum up:\n\n- Mediocre food\n- Bad service\n- Management that makes YOU feel guilty for their shortcomings.\n\nWith so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I recommend giving this place a pass.  None of us will be back.",168606

Which I'm sure they think is very edgy, but I just enjoy watching idiot tourists walk around searching in desperation for a sign to show them the way. Think you're in the wrong city for that.\n\nThe wait was a little long, but it was reasonable considering the high volume of shmoozies that were there. My friends and I stick to our traditional and delicious plain cheese pizza, and it was large and awesome. Not too greasy, a very generous size for a large, and the price is right.",495894

We were all upset and about to leave then she throws a paper at us telling us hurry up and order standing there rushing us saying come on hurry up and order.

The waitress recommended we get more, even though we had already run through the menu with her and settled on what we would be ordering.  The edamame arrived, and seriously 30 seconds later all the sushi made its way to the table.  We maybe spent 30 total minutes at the restaurant.  It was a overall a really unfortunate experience, and had it not been for the food, it would have been truly awful.",312520

Two groups were next to each other. The other group was across a walkway. We were fortunate to get the waiter who was probably new. He seemed to be a little panicked while the other waiter looked like he knew what he was doing. As for the group I was in, we had to wait a long time between ordering our drinks then ordering our food. This cause us to be the last finishing our food while the other group was ready to head out the door. Other than the service, the food was as expected...Good! I give the food four out of five stars. Service was a two out of five.",210156
0,"The hotel has a very confusing layout. Had to go to the back of the hotel to mess around with the parking. The parking garage is very small and confusing. The lobby was like entering a set of a 1970s tv show. Mirror chandeliers and out dated carpet. The check in line was very long and they only had 4 people checking guests in. I requested top floor and only got 17! I received 5749. I said there was no way that the room was on the 57th floor because the building didn't even look like it past 20 floors. We walked to the elevators which are beyond outdated. Scratched and scrapped up gold walls and Mirrors, doors and floors. I looked at the wall of buttons to push my floor and it had numbers 47-61? With arrows and other room numbers. I pushed 57 which is where my room was.  Got off and the sign in the hall said 17th floor but all the other signage says 57 but clearly we were not 57 stories high above the Vegas nightlife. It is extremely confusing and makes no friggin sense. That's all I ever heard the other guests complain about. The room we got was a \""luxury\"" in the \""renovated\"" Monoco tower. \""Renovated is an understatement! I think the last time it was update was in the 90's. The carpet on the halls was stained. The room doors are an old wood type very dark and ugly. The room was worse. It smells like mold as door are you open the door. The room was certainly not \""luxury\"" nor updated. The bathroom was terrible. Ugly old 1970's yellow bathroom tile and shower and old outdated bathroom fixtures. The shower head was the worst I ever had in a hotel. Everything in the room was dirty. The rugs the ceiling in the bathroom stains on the carpet. The desk and the pictures looked like it hadn't been dusted in years! The windows were absolutely disgusting and dirty. The view was pretty good except the view of the ugly buildings and dumpsters but overall it was a nice view. The bed was pretty comfortable I was surprised. The fridge didn't work and we had to tell them 3 times to replace it and they never did! We came one night and there was absolutely no parking! All the garages were filled and even valet was full! The one night we did valet the car it took almost 30 mins to get the car. And they were very short handed.  I didn't have any change to tip on me except a large bill so I went in the hotel to front desk and asked for change and the older lady told me no and I had to walk to the casino which was on the other side of the hotel to the cage to break it. Really? You can't give me some change? I'll never come back to this place. The casino was horrible. They advertise $1 blackjack and only have it On 1 table! Really? And they only had 3-4 other BJ tables but the min was $25. Really? The slots sucked and so did the players club which gave me a. $3.00 crappy shirt for joining and spending all my money in their hotel. The restaurants suck and are fast food places. Please update it. You can still have the history and old charm if you just update the dam place! Absolutely the worst! Save your time and energy and stay and play somewhere else!",133519

Oh and I found out the \""tea\"" I like is not really tea...my bad.\nSo I'm grading this place as more of a cafe.\nIt fit well inside an antique mall, so you can work up an appetite or walk off all the finger sandwiches and scones. \nThe room is small but there was enough room not to feel cramped. We were initially sat in their back private room but there was not alot of air flow and the sun was heating the room through its large windows. The waitress was happy to move our party into the main room, much more comfortable. The room reminded me of my grandmothers house but with plastic lawn chairs for seating. Cute, random table clothes decorating the tables. Staff was friendly and attentive.\nThe boys in the group got sandwiches and ice tea or lemonade. The girls got \""High Tea\"". I got the Strawberry Tingler rooibos. It was probably the best tea I ever had. I started with the corn chowder, very tasty with lots of chunks of vegetables. The finger sandwiches were good, fresh made, I added a little bit of salt to enhance them, but I like salt. The tuna was probably my least favorite. I preferred the Chicken salad, egg salad, and cucumber sandwiches. The scones were offered in 3 different kinds...apricot was the best, the cherry sour cream cam in second, the coconut chocolate chip I thought would've been the best, but I was disappointed. The jam and cream they serve along side is a perfect accompaniment.\nIf your looking for a new experience, its an affordable treat.",422383

After seeing so many positive reviews & recs on the place I knew I had to come back & refresh my memory of Mi Patio. \n\nMy dad & I came here for lunch this past Wednesday around noon. The parking lot was packed, that's always a good sign! I have to agree with Rand H, that the restaurant does have an odd shape to it. We were seated at a table that had a chair on one side & a booth on the other, I sat at the booth spot. Our table was kinda wobbly, definitely needed to stick a book or something under the table leg. \n\nChips & salsa were immediately brought out & soon after came our drink orders. The chips & salsa were pretty damn good & our server was very on top of refills. For our entrees: my dad ordered a bean & cheese burro & I ordered the baja spinach & feta cheese chimi, both came with a side of rice. Dad enjoyed his burro & ate about 3/4 of it, he didn't eat the rice though because he's more of a beans guys & is watching his carbs. I also enjoyed my chimi, very unique flavors, the rice was yummy & I finished it all. I had about half of my chimi left so I took it home to hubby, along with the rest of my dad's burro & his rice.

The menu includes breakfasr items but no lunch items and it does not have typical bar food either. No chicken wings yet there are tvs all over the place setting up the place to be a typical bar. It tries to be a wine bar but the wine list is very limited. We ordered the ordinary nachos which were decent and I also had the grilled  chicken sandwich which I ended up just eating the  chicken breast.  we went on a weekday so it might be different on the weekend but if u want a wine bar or a regular bar or a place to have a nice meal there are better options. the owners need to figure out what their concept is because it just left us confused and frustrated.,447201

1,"Proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  But take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.\n\nThe rolls at Mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  The fish is also not every good quality.  Want to avoid the rice?  You can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  Don't.  It is the worst pieces of fish I've ever had.  Also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  Many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  Probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.\n\nHaving said all that, I really wasn't surprised.  What was I expecting when I was paying so little?  But what really got me down was the service.  The staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  I was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  We figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  We figured wrong.  They brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray.  With some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  We then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  The server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.  Thanks for listening to a simple request.\n\nOne thing that was pretty fun about Mido was the music and lights that play when there was a birthday.  Once I finally figured out what was going on, it was a lot of fun.  Way better than an annoying birthday song by the staff.",311669

Our boss was going to pay not only for the rooms but the deposit you make in case anything else gets charged or things get ruined. They billed me anyways! Our rooms were not ready and they took our cell numbers and said they would call when ready, never did! Asked if we wanted coffee in our room. Never brought it! We asked them to bring sheets etc. for the fold out bed/couch and to please get it ready. Never did! At the pool we sat down and it took 45min to get a drink and just as long to get the bill! The only time we had some good service was at the little bar downstairs. Eric was great! This did not make up for anything though! DO NOT EVER GO THERE OR YOU WILL BE SORRY!

There is no way I would pay full price for the quality of food I was served and the price listed. I got 6 very thin buttermilk pancakes for $7. And a slice of ham costs like $5? I got a better deal eating at the signatures with an all american breakfast platter that costs $11.  \n\nIf you are coming here to find some great steals on mom and pop style off the strip hidden gems, and this is definitely the wrong place. Its over priced, and not worth the hype and drive. Go some where else like Egg & I or your local hotel.",73568

2,"We have been going to Eastwind for years. Two months ago I would have given it 4 or maybe even 5 stars. But certain changes recently are bumping down my rating.\n\nThe good\nMost of the food is delicious. My favorite is the vegetable tempura soup. Their happy hour is extremely affordable. Very cheap sake bombers. My husband likes the sushi rolls on happy hour. I'm not a fan of the vegetarian choices for happy hour. The sweet potato fries aren't very good. They don't have any veggie rolls on special for happy hour (c'mon veggies are cheaper than fish!) so I end up ordering my favorite roll, the veggie tempura roll, off the menu. It is always super tasty. The servers are sooo nice. They can be a little slow and forgetful when the restaurant is busy but they are too nice and genuine to get mad at them.\n\nThe bad\nAs I mentioned I usually order the veggie tempura roll for happy hour, even though it is not happy hour priced. Well, one roll isn't enough for me to get filled up so up to 2 months ago, I would order a side of PLAIN fried rice. Their fried rice is yummy. It was only about a cup full but it was perfect accompaniment to one veggie roll. Last time we went in for happy hour I tried ordering my usual veggie roll and SIDE of fried rice. The server looked at me with guilty eyes and said \""Oh, we can't do that anymore.\"" He said if I wanted to order fried rice I would have to order the $8 fried rice entree. The fried rice entree has an option of chicken or beef, which is probably why it is a whopping 8 bucks. I'm a vegetarian who just wants some damn fried rice without any meat but I am not going to pay $8 for just rice. The server said the manager put an end to the restaurant offering it as a side. Talk about nickel and diming! How cheap can you get? It's RICE! Apparently, the manager made a couple of other changes that the staff and patrons are not crazy about. \n\nUnfortunately, these small changes are making a huge impact on how often we will patronize Eastwinds. We might need to find a new sushi happy hour place...",28316
2,"Met some friends here for a birthday party...she loves it here...I came for the company.\n\nFirst of all, parking is retarded here.  If you don't care about people parking your car, DO THE FREE VALET.  I drove my boat back there trying to find a parking space, and I couldn't find ONE space I felt comfortable leaving my car.  I ended up parking in the hotel parking lot next door and walked over after leaving the frustration known as Firefly's parking lot.\n\nI wanted the Firefly fries that I've grown to enjoy...They come with Parmesan, Herbs, and an Aioli for $6.  Since I knew I was gonna order another plate or two in addition to the fries, I decided just to spend the money for the steak and fries :P\n\n14oz Ribeye ($20): Red Wine Sauce, Cabrales Bleu Cheese, Firefly Fries and Aioli. Surprisingly large ribeye for the money! It was a good steak, cooked perfectly, but the sauce/seasoning was a little distracting. Still good though!\n\nHowever, the fries were undercooked and stupid oily.  Like \""dripping off your fingers\"" OILY.  I should have returned them, but my steak was cooked perfectly, and I thought it was a waste to turn over the plate.  They probably would have just brought me a new side of fries, but that's in hindsight. \n\nSo you can still get a decent value at Firefly...just factor in bad parking and a hint of inconsistency and you'll probably be fine!\n\nPics :",606875

3,"I should just stop calling these reviews part of my cider tour of the Phoenix area and seek sponsorship from Strongbow instead because it's the only draught they, being bars with an Irish theme, have other than the one blowing up my arse about these being Irish pubs that is.\n\nDon't worry by my second pint this review gets friendlier. \n\nLet's start with the appetizers and the curious price of curry and chips. $8.95.The price of the curry sauce and the chips ($2.50 and $4.00 when ordered separately)  is an application of new math that I find puzzling. *\n\nOk the first pint is warming me up and it's time to praise the banger wontons Nope it's not an Asian street gang but a dab of pork sausage and herbs within a wonton wrapper.  These are really good, pretty inventive and the spicy sauce that comes with them ( seems to be HP , Vinegar and something I can't quite put my  tongue on ( horseradish?)  , while good, is a little  overpowering for the center.  We really liked these.\n\nPint 2:\n\nMy wife had the beer battered fish and chips and loved them but she'll get to that in her review. I had the shepherd's pie boxty , basically ground lamb/ beef  wrapped up in a potato based crepe/ pancake.  The filling was light, moist and nicely spiced  unlike the usual attempts by most places to hide up a culinary crime scene. E.g If you can't do the thyme...  The accompanying veggies, asparagus and peppers were a nice touch and you can see the visual appeal of the dish on the accompanying picture. \n\nDesert. \n\nWe had. ok we ordered,  the Irish whiskey creme brulee , most of the desserts here are about as Irish as George Takei, and it was absent of any whiskey taste that either of us could discern.It's OK but a let down given the promise.    Knocking off .5 stars for that and the appetizer pricing. \n\nFood came out really quickly  in under 10 mins. It  was about 1430 when we came in and the place was kinda quiet. Mallory provided great service throughout.\n\n*I wrote their corp office and Eric returned an explanation within an hour. the disparity in the chip/curry conundrum lies with the curry sauce. The \""side\"" of sauce is supposed to be 3oz less than the appetizer.",376692
1,"I've been here well over 20 times since I moved to Las Vegas.  Not by choice...this is my uncle's favorite place to go whenever he's in town.  My mom also thinks this is a great place to take tourists in order to have the \""Vegas-Strip\"" experience.  Maybe I haven't gone on the right nights but I literally count the minutes down until everyone else is ready to go.  Or maybe I haven't had enough to drink to fully enjoy the whole mess!\n\nMy most recent visit was last weekend.  My husband's best friend had Navy friends in town for the weekend.  We were meeting them at Harrah's.  When they were done eating at Toby Keith's, we walked to the casino floor.  Someone suggested we walk into the Piano Bar...I told them they weren't going to like it and to save their money for another cover charge...the group decided to go in regardless.  By the time everyone got their drinks, they realized the mistake and were ready to go!  The sisters had started playing and were slaughtering song after song.  \n\nThis is the positive things I will say about this bar...the piano players have unbelievable memory recall on the songs.  I'm not impressed by their singing talent but they do have impressive piano skills.  The other thing I was impressed by was one of the bartenders here.  Normally if a drink order is wrong, for whatever reason, they just throw it out and start over.  I ordered an Amaretto on the rocks and didn't specify Disaronno.  He gave me the mistake drink for free and made me a new drink.  I thought that was a pretty sweet deal! \n\nI know I'll get trapped into going there again!  LOL!  Cheers to Uncle Larry!  :)",323481

2,"We go to Madison about once a month for various Badger sporting events. Sometimes we do double-headers and have to find somewhere to kill some time between the two events. \n\nLet me put in here that I was a little disappointed by Yelp Madison - the top 10 reviews are for bakeries and coffee houses, making it difficult to find what locals think is a great place to eat. \n\nAnyway, we ended up choosing the Old Fashioned a few days in advance, so I spent some time looking at the menu online and was really looking forward to trying some of their food. \n\nBecause of the timing of the events, we got there about 4:30. The place was still pretty busy considering it was pre-dinner time. It's a good thing we got there at that time, since it was absolutely stuffed to the gills by the time we left at 6. \n\nDespite having like 140 beers, they carry just one hard cider, which I think is a little ridiculous. But I ordered it. It wasn't very good. \n\nSo I perused the giant beer menu and went for an apple New Glarus I'd had elsewhere and loved. They were out of it. And before I could even go back to the menu, the waitress let me know they were out of 2 other fruit beers. However, the waitress suggested a beer on special that, based on the name, I'd never had tried, but it was quite good. So good on her for knowing the flavor profiles of what they had available. \n\nSince it was early, I was still pretty stuffed from lunch and the meals there all looked huge. I knew from Yelp that the fried cheese curds were a must and I couldn't imagine how I'd handle a whole meal, so I decided to piece on together. \n\nI ordered the curds for us to share, then ordered a side of the dill potato salad and a bowl of the beer cheese soup. \n\nThe curds were as advertised - spectacular. But everything else was a disappointment. \n\nThe beer cheese soup is clearly made with sharp cheddar - it had that good, sharp bite. But it was also incredibly gritty because hard cheese like that doesn't melt well. You could see the gritty pieces all over the spoon. It was just an unpleasant texture.\n\nAlso, because it was so sharp, it was kind of a lot - if you know what I mean. It needed some bread or a pretzel or .... something to break up the strong flavor. It came with a small packet of oyster crackers, but those just soaked up the soup and didn't accomplish anything. \n\nAnd the dill potato salad didn't taste anything like dill. It was ok, but not great, but I as someone who loves dill, I was really looking forward to it so the lack of flavor really disappointed me. \n\nSo I think the food was probably pretty ok, but after reading the menu I was really looking forward to these things and they failed to meet my expectations. \n\nThe boyfriend, incidentally, had the Saturday night Prime Rib special and it was delicious. He ordered the \""small\"" and the plate was huge, with a giant mound of onion strings, which I don't think he even touched, plus a baked potato and the Prime Rib. The Prime Rib was melt-in-your-mouth. \n\nI wish my meal had lived up to the promise of one bite of his. \n\nWe were in the room off to the left of the hostess station and there is a long bar there. As the restaurant got more and more crowded, so did the bar and there just wasn't room for all those people. Folks were bumping into the back of the BFs chair and the servers couldn't even get through.",179360

I'm one of those people who has positive things to say about just about anywhere...but not here.  Don't get me wrong--I have no problem with this individual location.  I have been trying to order something site-to-store from the parent company website for three days.  First, they advertised it as one price but as soon as it went into my cart it showed up as costing $100 more!  Because of our timeline, I ordered the item.  Well, Guitar Center must have a HUGE amount of fraud, because my credit card was instantly shut down (and I buy a lot of weird stuff, a lot of stuff online, spend money in different countries all the time, etc--this was NOT an expensive item, either)..  WOW!  So once I get that cleared up, I sent a screen shot of the original price--a price that I had confirmed via telephone with GC CS rep Preston.  They \""lost\"" my first screen shot.  I re-sent it, and uploaded it to a server to provide them with a URL...so this time they couldn't lose it.  All the while, EVERY agent asked me to call them on the phone to re-order.  I went through a friend's affiliate link after they told me about GC, giving them appropriate credit for the sale--so this unscrupulous company was actually trying to get out of giving credit under the terms of their OWN affiliate program!  So now they're claiming they have to cancel my order and I have to re-order via the phone, or they cannot honor their own coupon code.\n\nWell, the STORE might be just fine.  I don't know.  I didn't make it that far.  But I can tell you that the parent operation is questionable.  I'd rather give my business to a more ethical operation.

He was patient as I tried to gather my party of mostly under 25 year olds and really just treated us well.  The staff was patient and friendly.  LOVE IT!!!!,180352
0,"Manager is a complete jerk. Customer service means nothing. I came in for dinner and drinks while restaurant  area was almost empty. I was told I could not sit at a booth because there were only two of us and we would need at least four. His reasoning was \""it might get busy\"". Instead we were seated at a small table where the game we were there for was almost impossible to see.  Pretty much every request was answered with NO for the entire meal by the waitress.  I had multiple experiences like this and finally had enough. I would go to the Tilted Kilt  or Arena just a few blocks away",252354

2,"I desparately wanted to love this place, after recommendations from the hotel, a bunch of website, open table and yelp...\n\nunfortunately, my husband's fresh fish of the day (Halibut).. lacked flavor (even basic salt) and the oomph we hoped to find at a top-rated expensive restaurant. \n\nWe went here for our third anniversary-- and although my cod with porcini was tasty, it was nothing spectacular.\n\nCalimari was also very basic-- but I dont think there is anything you could really do with calamari-- however, I would like to comment that it was not overly chewy and very fresh.... \n\nOur service was impeccable and the the ambiance is delightful...

3,"My second trip ever to the Stratosphere, and I still like it.  Sure, it's not a five star mega-casino a mile down the strip, but it's actually affordable.  The Deuce stops right outside the casino near the buffet and runs from Fremont Street to the Mandalay, with enough stops in between to get you where you want to go.  As for the surrounding area, you can actually walk outside and get a decent price on some food, or a bottle of liquor, for those looking to enjoy Vegas on a budget.  The rides were okay, the Big Shot being the only must do, but the views are awesome and the place is nowhere near as crowded as most of the strip casinos.  I highly recommend the strat, particularly the upgraded Select rooms.  My only negative applies to all of Vegas, as I am a non-smoker.  Nothing is more ridiculous than watching 50 people walk through a casino get irritated as they walk by one idiot chain smoking at a slot machine.  Eventually Vegas will realize most Americans do not indulge in this disgusting habit and ban it in public venues.  Until then though, we'll just have to suffer if we want to visit.",153525
0,"Dr. Luoung  placed a crown on me which became infected and incredibly painful. He then did a root canal and  drilled through the new crown he had just put on, and then said that he would replace the crown since he basically destroyed it. I went back a little later for a cleaning and he did not mention replacing the crown he drilled through. Then the crown collapsed. I went to him and said that the crown collapsed. He said that I needed to make an appointment before this happened !!! He refused to replace the now destroyed crown, because it now needed an implant. I should have sued him for this but for some reason I felt it wasn't worth the time and cost, and just decided to go somewhere else and have it taken care of, at great expense anyway. It had to be extracted ,($400.00) and an implant put in. ($2400.00) He didn't live up to his word and refused to fix his shoddy work that caused the infection in the first place!!!  I wouldn't go to this guy if it was free. Horrible dentist who is only concerned about saving a buck, even if he is responsible for the screw up  !!! Look elsewhere.",256391
0,We ate at the Arrowhead Mall Johnny Rockets tonight. The service was terrible  and the food was cold.

And I have to say, I think the prices are pretty reasonable when you consider the selection carried.\n\nTheir food is pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. I would say it's a step above your average \""bar food\"" menu, but it definitely isn't gourmet either. But with that being said, you get a good meal for what you pay for.

1,"I went on a personal recommendation with high hopes for finally finding a stylist in Las Vegas that I can trust. The atmosphere is very high energy. Sal is lovely and very engaging. However, for me the music is a bit too loud (I left with a migraine) and the haircut was not nearly as good as my stylist back East. Too much thinning and texturizing left my wavy hair with frizzy flyaways, no body and tangles. The color is almost the same as before the appointment, no improvement, but thank goodness no disaster either. I couldn't stand to have a bad haircut AND a bad hair color all at once. It looks as though I will be planning my future vacations to include a visit to my beloved, one and only hairdresser back home. There is no one in this city that comes close!",409834
2,"Heart Attack Grill is a hamburger joint with a zany parallel universe hospital theme.  Waitresses dress in somewhat provocative nurse outfits (The type of nurse outfits you'll see in fantasy playbacks in movies with everything all boosted up and sticking out).  Following the theme, each customer is required to wear hospital gowns upon entrance.  Their burger is eloquently named the \""bypass\"" and depending on the number of patties it'll be the single, double, triple, quadruple (more if you'd like...) \""bypass\"".  \n\nWhen a place is called heart attack anything, it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question.  Parodied movie posters are plastered all over the walls.  While I'm no Jason Bourne, I always do a scan of any place I go too before settling in my seat.  Here my sights stopped on a rather large scale.  Above the scale was an indicator pronouncing whoever weighs 350 lbs, WILL EAT FREE!  First off, if you weigh that much, eating here may be hazardous to your health.  I was lucky enough to see a fellow customer climb onto that scale and \""win\"" a free meal.  Sirens went off with applause following.  \n\nA close buddy from L.A. had been talking about trying this place out on a couple occasions.  The three of us looking at menus in hospital gowns was a sight to see.  After a couple chuckles we ordered.  The smallest of the group ended up ordering the triple bypass while I chickened out and got the double.  We all shared a side of chili cheese fries which could have fed five or more easily.  Sizes are massive and while I did finish most of it; I don't think it was a particularly good idea.  Splicing chili on top of each burger patty inserted another layer of taste to a burger that consisted mainly of overly greasy meat flavor.  Take out the notion I was clogging my arteries at an exponential rate after each bite, the burger was ok.    \n\nThe novelty of it all is an experience in itself.  Seeing a couple Japanese tourists being spanked by the nurse waitresses is another interesting sight.  Rule is if you don't finish, you get spanked.  I'm assuming this was optional since any normal human would assuredly have trouble finishing these burgers and not everyone got spanked.  Aligning their extreme gimmick with the same motto of a more adult Hooter's equating to more show than emphasis on food, Heart Attack Grill is worth at least ONE visit.  I don't know about a second.  My heart may not be able to handle it.",530519
0,"Is there a way to give negative stars?  We chose this place because it seemed like a nice quiet place to chill and talk.  At first, that's exactly what we got.  Our server was pleasant and quick with the drinks.  She left about 15 minutes after we sat down, however, and things turned awful.\n\nWe were harassed by 3 different homeless people for money.  Granted, it's not Fitzgerald's fault that homeless people come up to people sitting on their patio. However, they didn't take an active role in getting the homeless people to leave until one actually went into the bar.  They care about themselves not being bothered and not the customers sitting on the patio.\n\nAround 1am we were told it was last call and asked by a bartender if we wanted another drink.  By 1:10 our tabs were all closed but we remained on the patio talking and finishing our last call drinks. As with all drinking, we took turns going into the bar to use the restroom.  At 1:30am we were told that we couldn't go in and out of the bar (even to use the restroom).  At 1:45 we were told by a bartender that the bar closes at 1:30 and the sign in the window and google (which both say the bar closes at 2am) haven't been right \""for a long time.\"" The entire time this was going on, the bartenders were sitting inside at the bar with a \""friend\"" watching us. They were rude every time we used the restroom. They were rude about us being on the patio.  They were rude about picking up our glassware from the patio. At 1:55am they apparently got sick of waiting for us to leave and we watched as the bartenders ran up the street with the friend they were sitting at the bar with to make last call at another bar (which they told us they wanted to do earlier in the night).  The staff here do not care about this place or the perception their actions leave with the customers.  I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out $100 bills with every beer (which was only slightly above room temperature btw). There are far too many better options uptown to waste your time at a place that does not care about your business.",540816

Heist Brewery might just be the biggest beer thing going (for now).\n\nHeist has taken the craft-brewery tasting room concept and blown it out into a full-scale restaurant and bar. The beer is decent (nothing special), but the food is the star here. Lots of unique dishes and healthy options--it's hard to decide what to eat.\n\nWe came for an early dinner over Labor Day weekend and sat out on the deck (dog-friendly!) where a live band was playing. We were in a slightly hungover state so lots of fried stuff for us and it was all very tasty and in satisfying portions.\n\nOverall a great experience at Heist and looking forward to returning.",560641
0,"We came in for lunch with a $20 Yelp Deal.  The restaurant was located on W Sunset Rd/S Decatur Blvd in a gas station strip mall in Las Vegas.  There is a partition in front of the bathroom door.\n\nThe server gave us the dinner menus and he did not ask for our drink order..  The prices were really expensive.  My friend went up to the counter and asked if they had lunch menus.  There was one other couple having lunch.\n\nA female server took our order.  My friend ordered the Schweine Schnitzel and I ordered the Bockwurst.  Another couple walked in and sat behind us.\n\nThe female server came out of the kitchen and served  the couple behind us 25 minutes after we sat down.  They did not recognized what they had ordered.  The server went to the window at the kitchen and talk to the chef.  I heard her say she gave the food to the wrong table.  \n\nShe never came back to our table to appologize or offer us a free appetizer or beverage while we waited for our lunch.  How could she server the other couple our food!?\n\nThe male server brought us our food about 9 minutes later.  He did not say anything about the mix up either.\n\nThe Bockwurst was tasty.  The fried potatoes had pieces of crisp bacon.  The red cabbage was okay.\n\nThe Schweine Schnitzel was breaded.  There was no sauce or anything on it.  The  scoop of German potato salad was served cold.\n\nThe male server asked if we saved room for dessert.  My friend mentioned the mix up and asked for a free strudle.  He only offered us one.  \n\nThe Apple Strudle was served heated with a side of whipped cream and unsweeted cream in a dish.

I've been here 3 times so far:\n\nVisit #1 - 2 cars ahead of me - took about 10 minutes and I considered just driving away but decided to stick it through\nVisit #2 - 0 cars waiting so I was in and out in like 1 minute.  It was perfect.\nVisit #3 - 1 car ahead of me.  Took over 10 minutes so I drove away.\n\nWith that said my tip to you is this:  If there are any cars waiting then just drive away because you may be waiting there all day.\n\nI don't know if it is me or what, but I think waiting 10+ minutes for coffee is ridiculous.  This isn't Starbucks with 27 cars in line.  With just 1 or 2 cars this place grinds to a halt.  I don't know what the problem is.  My guess is that they offer 75 things on the menu.  Tons of coffee drinks, smoothies, sandwiches, etc.  They need to trim their offerings down 90% and only offer the basics to get people in and out ASAP.\n\nHopefully my Keurig will be fixed soon but this place comes in handy if there is nobody waiting or you have the patience of a saint.",549035
4,"Still the best in my book. Over 100 visits in the last year and I've been going here for several years now. I've tried other places and they don't compare. The pho here is the best in the valley.

I've switched from the 48 to the 48b (I like the BBQ pork more) and I've gone to ordering a Bahn Mi every visit. \n\nMost other pho places, for 2 orders of pho and a couple appetizers, will run $30 for 2 people with tip.

The BEST!!  It's Jamaica based and you can't get it anywhere else.  \n\nUsually, we get too full on the drinks because it's buy one get one free and it has to be the same person, so expect to buy two drinks.  So we usually just get one plate and split.\n\nFor some odd reason, this Pink Taco is way better than the one in Hollywood.  And it's not because we're in Vegas and we're already having a good time, but the quality of the food and especially the drinks are better.  I know this because I've ordered the same drinks from this location and the one in Hollywood and Vegas wins!\n\nThe atmosphere here is fun and the patio is right by the pool.

Every day from 4-6 you can go buy two Imperia vodka drinks and with this you receive 1 oz of Petrossian caviar including the full spread of toast points, hard boiled eggs, chopped red onions, and creme fraiche.

I really put a lot of time into deciding to go with the old reliable craft steak or trying the new restaurant. Should have gone to craft. \nfirst impression: The place is not as big or up scale as craft. They had plenty of staff but the service was not fluent, ok its a new restaurant and they are working out the kinks. Ordered drinks, took a while, ok we werent there to get drunk so no biggie. ordered the lamb ribs, hamachi, and the ash bone marrow. the hamachi and the ribs were phenomenal, the bone marrow (to my disappointment) was undercooked and didnt come with any toast so eating it was a bit weird. Ordered the tabasco peppered kobe skirt and my wife had the spice roasted lobster. The steak was ok at best, definitely not the same kobe skirt that they have at craft. The lobster was overcooked in my opinion and a bit tough to chew. For desert, we had mascarpone panna cotta which was very nice and tasty. oh yeah, and they were so nice to bring us a small bunt cake looking thing since I had notated in my reservation that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary. I am sorry, but if spending $300 per couple for dinner doesnt constitute a decent desert, then dont bother bringing me a dry little cake with a candle on it. overall, did not measure to the expectations, thought the menu wasnt impressive, lacked raw seafood and not a huge selection of steaks to choose from, etc. There are too many better steak houses in vegas for me to try heritage again, sorry Tom.",616433
2,"Great selection. The manager on duty was so nice and accommodating. But, I walked in at about 7:55 and was told by a salesperson before I even walked in that I would need to hurry because they were closing in 5 min. I was coming to get pillows and I thought that was pretty rude.",245234
3,"I didn't come here to shop, so I didn't get a chance to look through their items.  I came here to sell some of my daughter's old clothes.  I came in with 2 black bags of clothes and was told I could only bring in 1 bag and it had to be a white one.  Kind of weird and inconvenient since I didn't want to come back for a second time just to bring back the same bag.  Other than that, I can't really complain since they are buying my hand me downs.",72091

1,"To me Outback Steakhouse is on par with Applebee's or TGIFriday's - nothing special.\n\nThe food is okay, the atmosphere is okay, the service is okay. \n\nA friend of mine loves this place so the boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We all ordered steak. I ordered the outback special - a 6 oz steak with your choice of two sides - I chose fries and veggies. You get all this for $10. And guess what? It tastes like a $10 steak. I guess I've been spoiled at places like Mastro's and Morton's because this steak was not even in the same galaxy as steaks from those places. But it was $10 so I wasn't expecting it to be the best steak I've ever had either. Honestly, for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay. In retrospect I with I would have shelled out a few more bucks, maybe I would have gotten something a little better.\n\nAll in all, Outback isn't horrible, it's just not great. It's a chain and you get what you pay for.",48270
3,"I was just visiting Pittsburgh and I never been to the city before so I came here because everyone said that Primanti Brothers is a rite of passage.  So I went.\n\nHISTORY:  The original one is located in the Pittsburgh Strip District, a really busy area along with the Allegheny River which are dotted with warehouses and produce yards.  The owner, Joe Primanti, invented his famous sandwich during the Great Depression.  This spawned all kinds of sandwiches and the restaurant became a stop for late-night and early-morning workers.  For decades, it was a big food stop for truck drivers. Because they usually had to get their burgers or sandwiches to go, the restaurant started putting the fries inside the burgers and sandwiches so they can eat their entire meal with ease while driving. That eventually became their signature piece for all their sandwiches. Even though it's an eatery for all and is a foodery stop for everyone crazy about the Burgh, the original Primantis still keeps it's super large parking lot for truck drivers to make their routine stop for food. Pittsburgh is a working class city who loves (LOVES) their sports so Primanti Brothers is an insanely popular place to pre or post-game or to game-game while eating and drinking. It's now a chain that is all throughout the east coast but in Pittsburgh it's a staple.  Whenever TV stations (notably ESPN) do an expose on the city, Primanti Brothers is always mentioned, visited and spotlighted.\n\nFOOD: Heavy. They put their fries inside their burger. Um, I guess that's a novelty but conceptually it's like a turducken. Kind of too much.  But excess is the theme of all their signature burgers and sandwiches or you can custom-make your excess.  Add more fries, sauces, an egg, double up on meat, combine different kinds of meat.  Mention the word diet and everyone will look at you as if you're from California, which in this case, is true. But the restaurant, per their menu, states that their sandwiches are only the number 2 favorite.  The title of number one favorite goes to beer.  Not a particular kind.  Just beer in general.  Smile.\n\nSERVICE: Incredibly friendly and they love the question \""What's your favorite?\"" to which the answer will, again, be beer.  Another smile.  Tell them you're new and just visiting Pittsburgh, they'll relish the opportunity to fill you in on not just the favorites of the menu but their personal favorites in the city at large.\n\nCONSENSUS:  Definitely not a place to eat if you're dieting, paleo or vegan unless it's a cheat day or you relapse into the world of meat.  But if you can appreciate the hearty sports bar fanfare, you'll find yourself at home here with your stomachs full.  The restaurant, itself, is very welcoming and the bar area is incredibly social, especially if there is a game playing.  As a visiter of the city as a whole, I don't know if this is characteristic to the restaurant or the city as a whole, but, regardless, I will swing by again when I have business in Pittsburg in the future.  I'll just make sure that it is also a cheat day.",471072
2,"Stopped by here because we needed a quick bite to eat before the Michael Jackson One show.  Thought it would be faster if we went to the bar. Took a while for the bartender to show up, but once she did service was fine. We had the chili cheese kobe beef fries, which hit the spot. Decent place to watch sports as well.",588763

2,"I thought this place was pretty average as far as Chinese food goes.  Decided to try it out because other reviewers mention the plethora of vegetarian options.  On the menu itself there are no more vegetarian options than most Chinese places offer.  However, they will vegetarian-ize most of the meat dishes (I got General Tso's Tofu).\n\nThat said, it was not the greatest tofu I've had--kind of mushy, sauce was a bit watery (...or oily...honestly I couldn't tell which).  It also was not spicy at all.  I'm sure they'll make it spicier if you ask, so if you like your food spicy you should probably request it.  My food tasted alright and was definitely a generous portion, plenty for leftovers.\n\nService was quick and the place looked clean.  The food was just very...average.",11813
1,"Thai me up and take me to a different Thai Restaurant. The price and the decor are the only things going for Galanga. \n\nThe RJ Food section gave them a cover story review and romanticized about the DIY Thai Iced Tea so since I am junkie for Thai Tea I had to experience this. The presentation was original with the tea iced cubes, but when I individually smelled one of the ingredients it smelled like nail polish remover. Ugh. Maybe my smeller was off so I continued making my tea combining all of the ingredients and it was a fail. I didn't enjoy it and spent most of my meal trying to make the damn tea taste better. FAIL. \n\nNow for the food, the only thing going for it is the price. My lunch was $4.95 and came with soup or rice porridge which fell flat in the flavor department. Both my friend and I tried to dress it up with Sriracha, but decided it still didn't work for us. Second out of the kitchen was the Papaya Salad for $7.95. This tasted different than others around the valley which was due to the lime vinaigrette. It was bitter and missing something sweet or spicy to balance it out. Sad because minus the dressing this may have been a winner. Last to arrive was my Panang Curry Chicken. The portion was to my liking and the chicken appeared to be all white meat which usually makes me happy, but with one bite I knew I would never be back. It wasn't so bad that I spit it out, but it was just boring. Nothing should be boring about Curry especially when you order it at the highest heat level. The sauce lacked thickness and spice. It was at a toddler heat level which just pissed me off. This white girl likes it spicy! \n\nThe conclusion to this story is just because a restaurant looks good and the RJ raves about it doesn't mean shit. I will gladly spend double the price for authentic Thai then come to this fancy shmanzy crap hole again.",368331
0,"I am getting sick and tired of restaurants in this economy that don't know how to treat a customer.  It is not like they are over flowing with customers at best 1/4 filled.  I ordered the Croque Madam  when it came out the egg yolk was ice cold.  I asked the waiter if he could replace the egg.  Rather than just bring out a new sandwich the waiter came out and essentially blamed me and said the cook said that the egg was not cold.  Now I am irritated and ask to speak to the manager, a few minutes later, the so called executive chef comes out and continues to insult me.\n\nDon't waste your time with this restaurant, food is sub par the executive chef is clueless and the service is even worse.  They should just close the entire Aliante Casino.  It is one of the worst Casinos to eat at or gamble at.",579583

Fabulous use of the theater for theater-in-the-round staging.

Secondly, how is it that Hertz had a line an hour long while all the other car rental agencies had no one in line???  Something is seriously messed up here.  Once I finally got my keys, the parking lot number the car was supposed to be parked in didn't exist which led to the fun \""find the rental car\"" game because there was zero staff in the garage to help.\n\nOn the way back to the airport, it took us forever to find the car drop-off location because the signage sucked so bad.  The actual process of dropping of the car wasn't bad but then you had to wait for a bus and drive 200 miles back to the airport.",90846
1,"Service was fine - I sat at the bar.\nPartially this might be my mistake - i came here for late lunch.  I wasn't sure if I was into having an 8oz burger (ie the big bun) so I decided to go for the tiny buns (3 sliders per serve).\n\n2nd mistake - I ordered something other than a beef patty (pretty obvious this is a beef place).  I ordered the Ahi sliders.\n\nSo yes maybe other choices would have been better.  But for a place with burgers as main attraction as a burger?  The slider buns were very disappointing - cold and hard.  The Ahi had a spicy herb crust on the outside and tasted decent (nothing to rave about), the cucumber and slaw under the quartered piece of Ahi were actually in my opinion the highlight.  In fact I would have paid for that to be an Ahi cucumber salad much more happily.\n\nSweet potato fries I added were decent - but again not really memorable.\n\nThe redeeming thing?

1,Don't believe that hype - its a sequel... Went there on a Saturday night got confused with Moon - went there last year with friends and loved it but is closed now :(. Great view beautiful high end decor..... However no dance floor the man walk way has DJ setup and is the dance floor with DJ setup off to the side so everyone dancing is in the way of servers trying to get drinks out to the balcony and bottle service areas and even employees that need to bring supplies to the bar have to go through the dance floor causing spilled drinks etc (Moon had a large traditional dedicated dance floor which was great) . DJ was erratic gong from hip hop the EDM to old school to God knows what. Whatever type of music you like there's a song you like you go to the dance floor (walkway where people are dancing) then next track will be something totally different and kill the vibe (Moon had more consistent DJs). Balcony is tiny (compared to Moon which has an awesome balcony). Drinks were pricey $16 for bottom shelf well drinks. Very little seating other than bottle service areas. Like alot of the clubs in the last several years this club only makes sense to me if you a planning to go VIP and get bottle service and socialize. I you have to dance I would go to a place with dance floor and hip hop or EDM DJ etc depending on your tastes and preferences. We should have went to 1 Oak from what I hear. I miss Moon please bring Moon back that was 5 Stars for me.,181573
3,"I was looking for last minute hotels and stumbled upon The Riviera. I saw they had an offer one bed deluxe suite for 60.00 that included your living room with a wet bar, 2 bathrooms, a bedroom with a huge bed with a balcony with a decent view to the strip 60  a night sounded awesome.Then I read the reviews and was terrified and of course there was no refund if we cancelled. When we got there checking it wasn't as terrible like people said, but of course we got there at 6pm when check in was at 3pm but we checked in with no problem. We stayed on the Monte Carlo tower on the 26th floor, the one bedroom deluxe suite was very spacious the rooms are outdated but they're not THAT bad what really is in need of a renovation are the bathrooms. \nThe Riviera isn't the typical glamorous hotel you see at the middle of the strip, it's a blast from the past. I thought it was nice being able to experience a much older hotel, it's pet friendly also. Getting to our room wasn't such a long walk like in the other hotels. It's pretty far from all the shows but that's nothing a simple cab ride or a car ride can fix. This hotel isn't as packed as others it's very nice to walk around or catch a break from the night life. Overall it was a nice stay I enjoyed it staff was friendly, I hope they begin to fix their bedrooms soon and update many things (:\nIf you want an updated nice bedroom ask for the Monaco tower",133615

0,"There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""rewards\"" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.

Unfortunately the rest of the room wasn't much to call home about.",6723
3,Great place to get Chinese food. Want to add that I left my wallet there but didn't discover it was missing till the next day. I went back and they still had it all in tack. I am soooo grateful that the girl was so honest!,221146
2,"This review is for the Mojito Bar located in front of the Seafood Shack and we were staying at Treasure Island Hotel and got a 2 for 1 drink at the Mojito Bar as part of our package.  The drinks were good, we ordered a Mermaid mojito and Cherry Breeze and the breeze was a bit on the sweet side.",573139
3,"Massive portions of the Greek version of comfort food. It doesn't get much better than Z's for the price and convenience. Great staff, quick service, diner feel. I have had probably 80% of the menu and can't say any of them has been subpar. \n\nI'm here 2x a week for lunch, and my go-to meal is a falafel appetizer and a Greek salad with chicken.",298517
3,"Friendly service and fresh ingredients are the stars here.  I tried the special for the day, battered cod with 2 sides.  Our waitress explained that the cod was a fresh filet and hand battered.  I had it with steamed vegetables and clam chowder.  The clam chowder was also freshly made, and had nice large chunks of clam in it.  The chowder itself tasted a little too salty for me though.  The green beans were freshly steamed green beans, and they were a nice deep green color vs. the greyish mushy green beans you might usually see at restaurants.  \n\nService was excellent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Our waitress was very warm and friendly.  Sunny's Diner is hopefully here to stay for many years!",561819

My manicures and pedicures last forever. My husband asked if they use airplane paint (joking) because the color is so glossy and lasts so long. I have been going now for almost 2 years and have been very happy every time. Final word, kudos to Tina. I have never known her to be anything but absolutely sweet. She is a real pro.",415322
0,"Terrible service. Manager (Omar) was unwilling to listen at all. Our food came out cold twice but the server never came back so we finally just ate the cold food. I'm local and I can tell you there are far better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. The prices were about double what I've seen and for that I would expect someone to care. We probably saw our server three times and we had to be the annoying people who asked other servers for drinks, forks, etc. I would suggest avoiding this place.",576685

4,"Wicked Spoon is the best buffet I've ever. It's on my top 3 list of buffets to eat at here in Vegas. They have gourmet tapas style food here and everything is made fresh. For the quality of the food at this place, it's totally worth the $35. The Wynn itself is $40 for dinner and it doesn't even top this place. \n\nI've tried both their lunch and dinner and to me, I liked the dinner more because I enjoyed the dinner choices more. \n\nThe dessert area at this place is SO YUM. They even have gelato with different weird flavors! The PB&J gelato was so yummy and tasted like a real PB&J!! \n\nCome early or expect to wait around 1-1.5 hrs. But totally worth the wait.",491871
1,"LOCATION: Also referenced to Salt River or 101 and McKellips.\nATMOSPHERE: Typical casino atmosphere with tons of slot machines. This seems to be the place for the older crowd 40's and up. \nDRINKS: I don't usually do super sweet drinks but wanted something different so I had the pina colada which was not strong at all and topped with huge serving of whipped cream. We had to order two since we were at the free variety show so I had the diet coke too. \nVARIETY SHOW: Entertaining with impersonators of Celine Dion, Elvis, Whitney Houston, Garth Brooks, and a comedian. Not a bad show. The theatre is nice and comfy with nice low lighting. \nGAMBLING: Nothing crazy here... I played war and won $18... then went to the slot machines and lost $5.... end of story. \nSERVICE: No complaints here.\nFACILITIES:  I'm not familiar with the casino scene in Arizona but I've been to Vegas and overall seemed like nice facilities but nothing too fancy.\nPARKING: Huge lot but this place gets packed on the weekends so can be hard to find but you'll eventually find a spot. \nCONCLUSION: Nice experience but due to the older crowd probably would not return.....",44776

4,"Food that creates a smile is great food, but food that inspires--that's fantastic food.  The slider truck, although casually camouflaged with a comic theme and serving nothing but sliders, creates great eats that are inspiring for those who love to eat and for those who want to cook.  With the food comes the people, a plethora of individuals that somehow meld together into a friendly mass of hungry fans.  Despite the wait time for excellent sliders the people converse as if they know each other, making the wait seem like a few minutes rather than a bit longer.  I don't mind waiting in line with the cult followers because they are a mixture of artists, parents, students, geeks, photographers, and more.  While waiting in line for the slider truck you get an intelligent conversation in with great people. I love it.\n\nWith the crowd comes the need to feed, and the slider truck delivers wonderful morsels of juicy burger love.  They changed me, turning me into a fan of things I do not normally eat, and that is a feat in itself.  The menu is simple and there are days when they have secret menu items available as well, items that their regulars will wait an hour in line for just to get a taste.  Today it was the french dipper, a roast beef slider with melted cheese, onions and mushroom with a side of au jus.  I tried one and it was to die for--tender, juicy, packed from top to bottom bun and seasoned so well that I wish I ordered four more.  I will definitely dream of that french dipper till the next time it's on the secret menu.  When it comes to turning me, the pulled pork sandwich--one that I refuse to eat ever--became an instant favorite of mine from the slider truck.  It's perfectly cooked and the barbecue sauce is spicy, sweet, and oh so smooth.  That pulled pork is juicy and tender, well seasoned and the sandwich, although slider size, is packed full of it.  The other thing that I hate to eat are jalapenos, but they make a jalapeno jelly that I cannot get enough of on their Captain slider.  I could eat fifty of those burgers with the jalapeno jelly on it.  \n\nWith the mind changing food comes great service.  The owner handles the truck personally, along with three to four of his trusted friends that basically line cook to keep the food coming out fast.  They are all friendly, always smiling and they take extra care to pack everything nicely and with everything you need.  A great touch is the candy that you get with every order, because candy can make anyone smile even on a bad day.\n\nThese sliders are like no other.  They are amazingly filling, great tasting, with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The texture of the patties are perfect, and their sweet rolls that they split into a bun are yummy.  I love the slider truck with all my heart, and they inspired me to try something different every once in awhile.  if you think that this food truck is like others, serving plain food fast and greasy, you have it all wrong.  They serve unique, what I consider gourmet style sliders on the fly. With great prices and service, and the fun crowd and fun times trying to find the truck daily, this is a stop that I'm willing to drive across town to line up for any day of the week.\n\nLine up soon and get your slider fix today, before the food runs out.  The crowds are a plenty, but the specials may not last till you're ready to show up.  That's the fun in this truck--finding it, lining up, talking to people, and then finally eating your addiction.  Get it hot and fast with a smile.  What more could you ask for?  As for myself, nothing.  They are everything that I need when I want my burger fix.\n\nThanks for the inspiration, slider truck.",448147
4,"Love Tempe Marketplace, I prefer this Harkins over Cinemark. There's always nice people with great service and you're not waiting at concession for an oblivious worker to serve you and get in when your movie is starting like Cinemark. Also seems cheaper than Cinemark most days. Love the 3D they added! Love the seats, the food, the clean, everything. Can't beat it!",279224
4,"This place is legit!!! My first time after hearing about it from friends.  I am definitely returning and OFTEN.  The flavor was intense for me and authentic.  I split some food with friends and had half of the pastrami sandwich and a slice of pizza which was very yummy! Of course, I couldn't leave without trying their spumoni which topped it all...bits of chocolate and pistachios mixed within the flavors. Prices were very reasonable. Wanting my next date night there :)",259076
4,"Sushi is one of our mainstay foods especially when we travel and are eating late at night. And Mushashi really caters to the late night crowd. If you can sit at the bar, ask for Roberto. We've watched him evolve into a really great sushi chef, and we really like the interaction we have here. Be sure to inquire as to the \""belly\"" fish on hand - it's the best sushi.\n\nHappy hour starts at 11:00 pm till 4:00 am - and they have a special menu for the occasion, meaning that two can eat very well for $30.00 or less. \n\nNever eaten at the Tappan bar, so can't comment on that side of the house.",298844

1,"Oh, Westgate Center...\n I live just down the street from this shiny mecca of overpriced, mediocre chains. While I have never attended a sporting event or concert here I do frequent a few of the establishments within this development periodically. If you must eat here I recommend Kabuki (Japanese) or the Yard House (American, upscale pub food with an impressive beer and liquor menu). My boyfriend and I attended the 2011 New Year's Eve event here with a few friends for two reasons: 1)we had just moved here and 2) were too exhausted to do much of anything else. That was a huge mistake! I felt slightly misled as to what we were gaining access to upon paying for admission. Our admission allowed us to only stand in the middle of the common area and listen to a band and pay for a fairly expensive, limited variety of cocktails. All of the bars and restaurants had their own separate cover. Call me crazy, but that seems like a ridiculous business plan. It would have made more sense if they had raised the cover and allowed all of those people to flow freely through the restaurants and bars that Westgate offers. Don't be so stingy Westgate!",270818
3,"I went to dinner at Deseo with my friend while we were staying at my dads in Scottsdale. I am a huge fan of Latin cuisine so when I saw it was possible to get a three course meal for $39 I jumped at the chance.\n \nI chose the millionaire tacos as the entree which came with avocado and salsa and really enjoyed them. For the main I chose the eye fillet of beef and was pleasantly surprised at the size of beef served - it was great considering it was part of a three course meal. The beef was served with crab meat (not a fan), equadorian potato (delicious!), some peas and snow pea sprouts. Lastly the desert was just super delicious! I had a chocolate cigar and cappucino ice cream. \n\nMy friend and I sampled each others food and her entree and desert were really nice. Her main (chicken) was huge but wasn't as nice as her other courses. \n\nThe service was prompt and friendly, minus 1 star for the bland mojitos.",207071
4,"Two Words: absolutely delicious.\n\nThis place is chock-full of character. It's a great escape from a horrendous workday. I've never been to France but the vibe here feels French cafe-esque. The owner, who is French, is also the cashier and he is a total charmer. Plus he is happy to help you out with your order should you have any questions. Sometimes I just ask him questions I know the answer to just to hear his accent. I know I know....\nAnd It's also a family owned\\run restaurant so that also adds some warm and fuzzies to the experience.\n\nI've been here twice (soon to be 3x because I want to go back tomorrow).\nBoth times I ordered the chipotle sandwich and both times I considered licking every crumb and drop of sauce off my plate. I could say it was the flavor combination. I could say it was due to the incredible chipotle sauce and fresh avocados. I could also say that it was the fresh & crisp baguette it came on. I'll just say it was all of the above.\n\nI ordered a cup of the cream of celery soup today. I don't even like celery all that much, but I had heard the owner\\cashier describe it to the guy in front of me and I was sold. My only regret was I didn't order a bowl.... or a gallon. There was a distinct essence of  fresh celery in the soup but somehow, maybe magically, the creaminess mixed in with the freshness made this the best cup of soup I can remember. Apparently I do like celery.\n\nBoth times I ordered a coffee beverage. For the coffee snobs out there, myself included, they serve Illy coffee. For the non-coffee snobs -- this is AWESOME coffee. First time was drip coffee the 2nd was an iced white mocha.... both yummy.\n\nSo for a half sandwich, a cup of soup, and medium iced white mocha totals just 12 bucks..... a small price to pay for perfection, I'd say. Baguette Cafe is a jewel of a lunch joint. If I didn't work in the area, I'd find an excuse to drive across town just to enjoy it.\n\nRun don't walk to this place. It's an all-around crowdpleaser.",421601

It was neither spicy nor that great of hummus.  It was the second course that made me realize that I was in for a bad meal.  My greek salad was an iceberg lettuce with some feta cheese on top.  It did not taste like a greek salad to me.  My entree, shrimp with vegetable skewers tasted really bland.  \n\nI did enjoy sitting al fresco facing the fountain.

1,"After hearing about this place from several people I wanted to try it myself!  The place had a few folks that were dining, no wait to sit.  It was around noon. I was torn between breakfast and lunch. I decided to get \""Chicken and Waffles\""  after a short wait my food arrived. I should add I did not get the pecans that were supposed to come on them.  Anywho I got the maple syrup that the waiter recommended. The waffle was light and fluffy with a nice crisp.  Nothing to write home about.  The chicken.. was extremely hard.  They were the chicken strips breaded. I honestly Felt like Chevy Chase in Christmas vacation eating that burnt turkey.  Three pieces came with it. ALL three pieces were way over cooked.  I had to say something to the waitress. Her response surprising. She said \""yea we get that a lot,  most people  soak it in maple syrup to soften it up\"" I'm like are you serious?  She continued \""it gets hard sitting under heat lamps,  when I have it I really gotta tear into it with a knife\"" hold up?  Its chicken strips a knife shouldn't be involved. I make fried chicken strips all the time and I NEVER have that problem. This place gets two stars from me based on the \""Leather\"" Chicken strips and the \""I know this and it sucks\"" tude about the chicken.",582469

But it is not worth any kind of drive. There are a hundred Mexican joints in the valley as good or better. I had the flauta special. Nothing special there. Three run of the mill flautas, a quarter cup of beans and a quarter cup of rice. The beans were ok the rice was not worth putting in your mouth. Plus you get to eat off of styrofoam to go boxes. The bean and cheese burro was run of the mill fast food Mexican. The only good thing I can say is the tortillas were above average. We bought a dozen to take home.",28563

1,"Where to start.... I used to shop here a LOT and still do sometimes (due to it being so close to my home), but the place is well below the standards that every other Walmart seems to have. I have read Made in America (Sam Walton's autobiography), and he would roll over in his grave to see this location.\n\nI would like to note first and foremost that the Pharmacy always gives excellent, consistent quality service. \n\nWe have had two cars damaged just from simple oil changes here (I know, partially our fault for going back). One they stripped the threads on something requiring a trip a to an ACTUAL car repair shop (where we should have gone in the first place), the other they simply didn't put the oil cap back on and I realized it after about 20 miles of freeway driving when the engine gave me trouble, smelt like burnt oil and when I opened up the hood it was EVERYWHERE. They told me they reviewed the tape and their oil change guy (I hesitate to use the word mechanic) did nothing wrong. I was also told the manager would call me after talking to an assistant manager, however, this never happened. This bugs me more than anything else, even the damage to the vehicles. I don't know if it was a mistake on the assistant managers part or if the stores general manager just didn't want to talk to me, but it is absolutely inexcusable from any angle with a company that (usually) has as good of customer service as Walmart does.\n\nAlso, many things are consistently not stocked if you go in the evening. I know they only stock overnight, but I don't understand how they can so consistently not realize that certain items simply need more stock on the shelves. \n\nEmployees often smoke immediately outside the front doors close to closing time so  you can't avoid the smoke.\n\nDefinitely the second worst Wal-Mart I have ever patronized. \n\nOn the bright side, the frustration with this location has made me realize how much better, cleaner and competitively priced the Safeway down the street is!",102008

Both were excellent dogs, and their beer list is incredible.  \n\nAgain, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes off as real?

It was perfect for our party of six, four adults and two children.  \n\nWe ordered our favorite the Fat Greek Combo, Zeus & Athena Beers and by recommendation from Jennica, the Greek Fries and  Flaming Feta, of course chicken tenders and spaghetti for the kids.

1,"I had been to this theater many times in the past but after a recent trip I had to ask myself, what happened? Over priced tickets for movies that have been out for several months, I do not think so. I went there with my nephew to see one of those Disney kid flicks and could not believe they had a huge line being handled by only 2 people. \n\nHere it is over 100 degrees and me waiting in line. So I decide to go inside and buy tickets from the ticket kiosk. Big mistake!! The machine did not work correctly and told me that it could not complete the transaction. So after speaking to a clueless manager who acted like I was wasting her time by asking for her help,  she goes and prints out two tickets. So before we headed into the movie we stopped to get a drink at the concession stand. Guess what? \n\nAnother big line with only one or two people working. So after paying 4 dollars for a drink and $3.50 for a small popcorn that was old and stale ( requested fresh popcorn) I made a quick stop at the bathroom. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. It was dirty, with paper towels on the ground and toilets that would not flush. \n\nTo top it all off later that evening I found out that I had been charged 100 dollars for two tickets!! Turns out the ticket machine put through the charge but would not print my tickets. When I called the theater they said it happens all the time. \nThey offered no solution to the problem and I had to spend three hours on the phone with the bank to get the charges reversed.

Fine it was supposed to have 3 live bands and I understand that we need to pay to see them. THe last band did not show up. WTF!!! they should have told me that at the door. The band that was playing was more interested in fornicating with one groupie that was there. We had to hear a whole monologue from each of the band memebers about how they deserved a dollar stuffed in their whiteys which was fine as long as they actually played a song but nooooo... we will not play until we get a dollar stuffed down our small weenies. \""Then I will give a lap dance to the groupie and still not play\"". \n\nGreat!! and I had to be there to waste my time and money to observe this.

Don't forget to add avocado sauce.   \n\nTake 'em to go or enjoy them on the tables and chairs in the parking lot. \n\nI have taken out of town visitors, family and gone on date nights here.  You can't say it's not an authentic and memorable experience, that's for sure.    So glad Nogales Hot Dogs is just down the street from my house!",349638
2,"Nice venue, not so nice compared to other vegas clubs.\nNice patio view of the strip with a small dancefloor. I think there were two middle aged couples dancing on the dancefloor and people had to walk around them or squeeze through. Talk about a lack of space.\nDid I mention everyone there was middle aged? Not a youngster in sight, not my idea of clubbing.\nDrinks were ok. Not the best.",181448
3,"I agreed with some of the post that say this restaurant offered the items you don't regulary see in most Thai restaurant.  The menu is big and has many variety kind of food from noodles, rice, steak, curries and salad depends on what mood you're in. Pictures on the menu is a big help to kinda give you the ideas of what the food will look like. They did a really good job on that.\n\nService is nice. In fact I got all the servers waiting on me.  Place is very clean and modern. The staffs were friendly and attentive. For a quick lunch it's nice to be able to grab 2-3 items food from what they called a la carte which is prepared food similar to Panda Express. The price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would recommend anyone who want to try their a la carte to get in before 1.30pm for fresh food. Otherwise if you get there later than that it seems like the food is old and had been sitting there for a while.\n\nI have no complain about the food here. Food is always good and full of flavor. They have the best Pad Thai ever! Must try! I tried to order something different everytime I go there. So far so good.\n\nI got a kick out of reading the review below that give Thai Cafe 1 star. Seems like this is their first time having Thai food and they have no idea what to order. I went there on Friday and saw the happy hour stand on the table that says $1 off appetizer/salad between 5-something and during the football game. Also the Thai beer was only $3. \n\nI've never heard of chicken in papaya salad before. If I'm wrong please let me know but I think you're mistaken it for something else? Papaya salad is very refreshing by the way.\n\nGinger salad is supposed to be grounded meat wasn't it? There was a picture on the menu I believe. I ordered mine with chicken. It had a very good flavor but too much ginger for me.\n\nOverall I have good experiences so far with this restaurant. It's our favorite Thai restaurant! Don't judge the place by the reviews, go try it yourself.",448914

I first brought my car to them in mid August 2011, and I've been bringing it in periodically since then, with symptoms of disappearing coolant, overheating, intermittent starting issues, all of which point to head gasket issues. They failed to diagnose this and they had several opportunities to do so! Never again will I bring a vehicle to this shop.  If you want a good Ted Wiens shop, go to the one on Blue Diamond and Arville.",257236
4,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was extremely attentive, the room felt luxurious enough to warrant the price (we were in the Tower, an upgrade we made at checkin for a very sweet deal). I loved the bathrobes and flirted with the idea of buying one until I saw the tag in the hotel store (200 dollars, alas).\n\nThe more secluded pool you get when you upgrade was very nice and not crowded, with prompt service by the extremely helpful eyecandy, I mean staff.\n\nOur room deal included tickets to Le Reve, which was incredible. If you have a chance to see it I highly recommend you do. Much better than O in my opinion, but in a similar vein, combining dance and gymnastics and diving, with artistry in the visual effects that is mind blowing.\n\nWe also ate at their breakfast buffet, at 10:45 which it turns out is a good time to go- you can eat both the breakfast and lunch menus as they transition over. The bottomless margaritas were a good deal, since we definitely got into the spirit of the \""bottomless\"" part.  I was very impressed at the variety of dishes, and how good they were considering it was a buffet. I'm trying to remember what we had, but the names of specific dishes seem to have been drowned in the sea of OJ and bubbly.\n\nThe casino did NOT smell like cigarette smoke, which is always a plus for me. We only saw it as we passed through, as we weren't there to gamble.\n\nSave up your $$$ and give it a try.",132428

2,This place is definitely a dive but I can't say its not delicious. The wings aren't as scrawny as most places I go to;they are actually good meaty wings.The hot garlic is probably my favorite sauce because I can't get it anywhere else. The fried zucchini is also awesome. Service and food is great but the atmosphere could use some work.,359171

1,"We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average; your basic bar food, some with a Cajun flair.  From the grungy feel of the restaurant, I wouldn't want to experiment too much with food here, especially where seafood is concerned.  \n\nIf you're in college, like to party, and in your early to mid-twenties, Dixie's may seem like a cool hangout place.  If you're anything else, there are better options in Uptown.",6645
4,"Had the Lunch buffet, best Indian I've had on the west side by far. I've had 8 other Indian restaurants, and none of them have come close to being this good. \n\nFirst positive sign, everyone in the place was Indian. Second positive sign, all the food was spicy. Had to ask for a Masala Dosa for my daughter so that she could eat.\n\nDelicious. Will be back soon.\n\nThere was a TV that was too loud. I really hate having TV on at places, let alone with volume on. Someone asked they turn it down, and they I think didn't understand the English well enough to comply.\n\nCould be an issue going forward.",574364

3,"Yum yum and more yum. We ate here last year and it was great so thought we'd try it again this year and definitely not disappointed. I had the vegan veggie burger (I'm not even a vegan) which was grilled eggplant, capsicum (I think you call them red peppers here) zucchini, on a mushroom cap bun (no bread) and it was delicious and super filling!! My partner had the All American Classic which he loved as well. \nThe service was fabulous despite being packed and even allowed me to change my skinny fries to sweet potato fries a few minutes after I ordered without a hiccup. They had a great service where instead of just waiting they just messaged us when our table was free and we were seated 2 minutes after we put our names down. \nWill we come back here? Definitely!!",155697
3,"First of all, excellent name. Not a clue where it comes from, but it is wonderful.\n\nThis is a solid place to see a show. I was here for the Fringe and saw a few things throughout the weekend here. All of them comfortable, great sound, lots of fun. The only issue it really has against it is it's a maze. Trying to get anywhere in here is a journey. They do their best at labelling and putting up signs, but I think I still had to ask someone each time I wanted to get anywhere.\n\nBut it's a slight price to say for an excellent show venue. Got a chance to see something here? See it.",357503

We are committed to making weekly visits to Cafe Bink to show our support.",324384

2,"Honestly I wasn't impressed. I've been to fantastic sushi restaurants including Nobu in NYC, so maybe I have high standards, but the way I like sushi is when you actually can be impressed by the quality of the fish. Unfortunately, the specialty rolls that Cyros offers seems to cover up the taste of the fish. Their most popular roll, the Cyros Avante Garde, had fried shallots and garlic on top...way too much garlic flavor for sushi. I will say the service is friendly and they have a good selection of sake. Other than that, the atmosphere is not so great...head to Roosters next door for a better atmosphere. Otherwise if you're looking for sushi that actually tastes like sushi, head over to Yama or Ru San's.",426035

I am so glad that I did. I was checking out the dog supplies and Howie got a new water and food bowl and a new toy and id tag and I got a key chain too:) OK there were other purchases made but when I was looking at the dog stuff I needed some help and it was so amazing how helpful everyone was. The girl who was helping me went to get me a basket and chatted for a few too, like it was no hassle. Then at check out it was so pleasant. When I got home it was so nice to see everything wrapped so nicely. Thanks for taking the time and effort!!!",251465
4,"This rare, healthy restaurant is hidden from the masses, slot machines and smoke filled Vegas corridors  located near the spa in the Palazzo. Only problem is it's been found, and tons of people were here.

The salad was perfect for lunch and the moist, organic salmon was cooked to perfection.

Plenty of room at the bar, we all ordered drinks, then were seated within 5 minutes. \n\nWe ordered the corn dip to start, still delicious. I tried the Farmhouse burger and it was AWESOME!!! The tomato jam really made it special, as well as the fried green tomato on top (and of course, don't forget the bacon!).\n\nWere ordered small orders of all the fries to share and they were delicious, as usual.

Just two questions about the food. I'm sorry I want to know how many lbs and don't want a surprise bill. He didn't tell me the price so I ordered something else. WTF? Doesn't a restaurant want their customers to order one of the market price entrees? I guess not. \n\nWhile I was ordering, he seemed annoyed, snooty (lol, ok Mr. waiter) and rushed me while taking my order. I know I shouldn't expect much from a Chinese restaurant but there are other Chinese restaurants with decent service. The food was average. I'm glad I didn't get impressed with their food. Yup. I would NOT come back.",72529

3,"I've stayed here twice but the last time I stayed was a couple of weeks ago as part of my honeymoon. The check-in line was long and kinda dragged, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Everything else was great. \n\nThe lady checking us in upgraded our room for free since we mentioned we were on our honeymoon. We got a spa room, which is just a room with a hot tub in it. I LOVED the view from the room! We were on the 33rd floor with a great view of the strip. The bed was comfortable, the hot tub was great and I loved the fact that there weren't a lot of rooms on our floor. We didn't hear much activity up there and felt like we had the whole floor to ourselves. \n\nWe ate at a few different places while we were there. We knew to stay away from America since a lot of people got sick there, according to a few reviews. I tried the buffalo wings and fries from the Sportsbar restaurant (I can't recall the name). The wings were ok but instead of dipping the wings in the buffalo sauce, they cooked them in it so they came out a bit dry. Still pretty good if you dip them in ranch. The fries were really good! We had one order of the regular fries and one order of the parmesan fries. Get the regular fries. My husband got the sliders. They were ok. \n\nWe then tried a place that was famous for it's burgers. I can't recall the name of this place either but you can't miss it since it's around the same area as the Sportsbar place and they literally have all kinds of burgers. It's their thing. I really liked that place. The burgers were good!! The service there was awesome. The waiter we got was very attentive and made sure we always had our glasses full. \n\nAs for the gambling, I don't gamble much but I did play a few of the slots. They were ok. \n\nOverall, I would stay here just because the rooms are comfy and I always get a room with a nice view.",160864

Add one beer and 1 soft drink and $26 total. \n\nAs I said, a bit pricy, individual tacos are $3.50 each.

1,"Disclaimer: I am not a resident at Paragon. I went in looking for a 1-bedroom apartment. \n\nI am on the hunt for an apartment and I took myself through north scottsdale today, stopping in at paragon on my tour. I would say that just about every apartment sales office that opens on sundays (some don't, granted) opens at 12PM and stays open to 4 or 5PM. I arrived at 12:45 to find out that Paragon doesn't open until 1PM. lame. I toyed with leaving and not seeing the property, but didn't listen to my instincts (mistake #1). I waited it out and came back at about 1:05. \n\nI walk inside and there is no one at reception, well fine, i'll just wait. Someone yells from the back \""Morning!!\"" I don't know if they are talking to me so I say nothing. \""MORNING!!!\"" again. \""oh hi there\"" I reply. \""You are just going to have to wait, I'm setting up still!\"" Huh? Who says that? I wasn't complaining about waiting, and besides that, you don't talk to clients or prospective clients that way. \n\nIris walks out and offers me a cookie as she walks by saying \""you know we don't open until 1PM\"" me: \""It is one, isn't it?\"" her: \""barely.\"" UGH! Why didn't I leave?! Then we are talking and she's getting my info and she asks my price range and then tells me \""oh well you won't find that here.\"" and yet I didn't leave (mistake #56 at this point). So for the first half of the tour and explanation she is a big puffed up elitist telling me how exclusive this is or how fancy and amazing that is.  Amazingly by the second half of the tour she was telling me she could get the price down to my price range (through flagrantly faulty math) and saying she could really picture me here. Yikes, no thanks lady!\n\nA 1-bedroom here runs $990 a month with no utilities included. The apartment and the complex are nice, but I have seen apartments that are equally as nice with the exact same amenities for $250 less per month.

2,"Haha, I never thought I'd say this, but I've had better in Wichita.  The pupusas here are a little bland, though the variations were interesting.  They did not have much crust on them.  The crudito was not pickled long enough and also bland.  We also had the corn tamales with crema and frijole.  One tamale was fried and the other was boiled.  I've never had them fried before; my husband prefers it this way.  I prefer it boiled since it's creamier.  Service was indifferent but quick.  Prices were cheap.  Average all around, so it's unlikely that I'll return.",267043

Bland doesn't even describe them. We got the Sakura and Geisha roll and for all the delicious goodness that was supposed to be in them, I was extremely disappointed at how crappy they were. I was totally in the mood for sushi too, which makes it suck even more! They were a nice size, which is why I gave this place the 2 stars. At least I wasn't starving, I was just lacking good sushi when I walked out. And the service there is almost as bland as the food is.

The truffle and pieces set this apart from an ordinary Caesar.\n- Ahi tuna tacos with ponzu chantilly, Serrano, and avocado cream.  Three small tacos that were so delicious.  Could have eaten a couple more on my own.  \n- \""in  the shower\"" mac n cheese, lobster and brunoise vegetable.  Delicious with good amount of lobster mixed in.\n- Black angus sliders, with caramelized onions, bacon and frites.

The ribs were a tad dry.  \n- Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9 with orange cr\u00e8me anglaise and orange-cardamom ice cream.  Wow, this was one amazing dessert.  It was delicious down to the last drop.  Had me licking my spoon.\n\nService was excellent.  We were talking about the wine cellar with our waiter and he even took us on a tour of the cellar after our meal.

The iced tea was good though.\n\nIf you are vegan or have a food allergy, this restaurant will be great for you.  However, otherwise, you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan label that lacks flavor.

My favorite is the smoked salmon croissant--creamy, just a bit salty, all encased in a wonderful flaky crust. Think fancy-ass Hot Pocket.\n\nA note about the drinks. DO NOT GET LEMONADE to go. EVER. I did that today, and it cost just a little less than my croissant. I was surprised to learn that my drink was 3.25, but then I went to their website and learned they do free lemonade refills.

The casino was one of the busier ones at night (due to the location or perhaps due to the Carnival Court outdoor party that goes on all night and attracts frat boys galore) but it was not unbearably busy and the cocktail waitress did come around often.  Toby Keith's I Love this Bar & Grill and Kerry Simon's KGB are both good and prices were reasonable (separate reviews to follow for the restaurants). \n\nHarrah's can best be summed up as being a good place to stay for those on a budget that still have standards.  Cheaper rooms can be found (Imperial Palace, Circus Circus, Riviera) but I have heard horror stories regarding cleanliness.  The fact that they don't charge resort fees is a huge plus and the Total Rewards program is one of the better casino rewards programs around.",128909
1,"Sat down and was checking out everyones food. Looks ok, yeah we'll eat here. So my husband orders a beer, they don't have it. Ok he'll have this other beer on tap, NOPE don't have that either. wth? The handles are on the tap thingy. So they lady unscrews all the ones that are out. 4 out of 5 were out. wth? So my hubby got stuck with bud light. Then I order a hot chocolate. She walked around the corner still stirring it. Yuck tastes like chalky water. So I send that back and ask for a pineapple juice. They lady once again comes around the corner, this time licking her lips. Hands me my drink and says yeap that's good. My husband and I look at eachother. So I grab another straw and yep it's good but kind of hard to mess up pineapple juice. \n\nNow to the food, no untensils no condiments, had to ask for everything! \nSo I ordered a short stack of pancakes (2) with a side of ham. Pancakes were just ok, I can do bisquick better. Ham steak was cooked on the same grill as the regular steak so had a charbroiled steak taste. Yuck.\nMy husband ordered a chicken sandwich which came with curly fries. He truely believes the fries were frozen and the chicken sandwich too. He ate it but only because starvation kicked in. Which I would have went back to the BACKSTAGE DELI @ THE LUXOR_yum!\n\nSkip this place not worth the time or money. Hit a food court if you're that desperate.",133717
4,"I'm visiting from LA, where we may have a good sushi place or two.  But I found this restaurant on Yelp, and off I went, thinking I'd look more toward meat items, as I'd eaten at another sushi restaurant the night before.  When I pulled up to the restaurant, admittedly I was a bit worried, because the signage made me think cookie cutter strip mall Japanese restaurant.  (Usually, when I think Japanese restaurant in a strip mall, I feel more comfortable if it looks like a dive.)  But generic outside appearance aside, this restaurant holds its own with some of the top restaurants of its kind in LA, and brought to mind restaurants like Wa and the original Katsu-ya.  I began with a house specialty, yellowtail sashimi with just enough tempura jalapeno in a garlic and yuzu-based sauce, before moving on to beef tataki, seared to a beautiful texture with a garlic chili oil.  Both were delicious and perfectly tender.  From there, the chef came out--it was wonderful to get such personal attention (and the restaurant was quite busy)--and we discussed what I might want next.  He suggested I try a white sea bass he had just gotten in, and then a trio of taro tostadas, each a combination of a different fish, spice (as in heat) and avocado cream.  They were fabulous small bites.  I finished my meal with the signature miso marinated black cod, perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful, accompanied with a yuzu-based vinaigrette that complemented it perfectly.\n\nMy primary server was quite attentive and personable (as were all the others), the setting is unpretentious and comfortable, and I didn't know until the end that Chef had graciously given me the white sea bass and tostada tastings.  That was just the cherry on top of an exceptional meal.  It won't be the cheapest Japanese meal you've ever had (though the prices are very fair for what you get, and there are good deals to be had at happy hour and lunch), and if you're a quantity over quality person, there are probably better choices, but if you appreciate top quality, extremely fresh ingredients handled deftly by a talented chef, this is your restaurant.  Even if it were in LA, Soho would still be a standout.  Next time I'm in Vegas, this will be at the top of my list.",620164
4,"Words cannot describe this show. Garth is amazing. His last tour ended in 1998 and since then he has stayed at home in Oklahoma raising his children. When his tour ended I was a little too young to be going to concerts. \nI had always said that there were only two reasons I'd ever go to Las Vegas. One was to see David Copperfield and the second was to see Garth Brooks if he ever came. Well, I saw David a couple years ago when he came to San Jose and last October I learned that Garth would be playing at Wynn. \nThe tickets are VERY hard to get. The first series of dates sold out in 5 hours. I was, unfortunately, not one of the lucky ones that got tickets that day. I did manage to get tickets earlier this month and planned the trip around my mom's birthday. \nIt was just Garth and his guitar up on stage. In this particular show that I went to he started out talking about what influenced him growing up and who his father and brothers were listening to. He started taking requests and even brought out his wife- Trisha Yearwood- to sing a couple songs! \nHe is a very amazing and talented artist and that showed on stage once again.",426712
1,"Forget the hype....your neighborhood sushi place in a strip mall is probably better.  Sure you don't get the Vegas scene, but you also probably get better service, similar quality and a whole lot more money in left your pocket.  The only brief star of the night was the hostess stand.  Friendly to a fault, they patiently waited for my entire party of 6 a full 30 minutes after the reservation time - and they didn't punish us with a poor table or attitude.  The server was fair - guests at my table had to ask who they had to bribe to get their beer delivered - but what do you expect on a Sunday night at 8pm.....hmmm.  BTW - this restaurant is so noisy you can barely hear people at your own table.  Good luck.",162199

She'd been considering buying a treadmill, too, so she chose one to try out and found that it was \""locked\"". A salesman wandered by and asked if she was interested in buying - she said, possibly so, so he unlocked the treadmill. After trying it and thanking him, he then told her to \""come back when she was ready to buy\"", in an \""I'm not taking you seriously\"" kind of manner. Not once was he the least bit friendly or did he even crack a smile. That is the last time we will visit that particular store. Poor customer service or was he just having a bad day (although the store had just opened and there was no one else around!)? Never again!",267684

0,"This is by far the worst restaurant experience that I have ever encountered so far. I've driven by Sevens' plenty of times before they opened, looked them up online and was excited to try them out. Their menu looked really good and tasty. I finally got around to having dinner there this past weekend. The menu you see on their website for lunch & dinner is not what you'll see when you go in. Online, they combine both their lunch and dinner menus making it appear larger. But when we were there on a Friday night around 7, we were only given the dinner menu which was about half the size. Now that I'm looking at their menu online, the prices are also not accurate. It's probably because they're showing the lunch prices which are typically lower.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was dead. There were a few people at the bar and two other tables. We were seated inside the restaurant close to the patio. They had the patio doors open making it way too cold. Some heat lamps were definitely needed. Good thing I wore a leather jacket. The restaurant is really well decorated, clean, and modern. I didn't see what it used to look like as Avalon so I don't know how much they remodeled. We were greeted and seated right away.\n\nWe got the monkey bread and spinach and artichoke dip to start for 5 of us. The monkey bread was raw. At first we thought it was gooey cheese, no it was raw dough. Bleh! We told the waiter and he took it away and later brought us out a new one. The new one was clearly burnt. I didn't even bother trying it. The small piece of the first one I had was okay. Tasted similar to Red Lobster's cheesey biscuits with some honey. I thought it was supposed to have garlic butter? The spinach and artichoke dip came out on a huge plate. However, there were probably 8 wedges of pita to go with it. The dip was edible but way too garlicy. There needs to be more pita for the proportion of dip though. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the duck sliders to split and the lemon basil chicken. Other people got burgers, duck sliders, and french onion soup. The duck sliders were okay. I took the onion, cilantro, jalapeno off because I don't like them. We also asked for the spicy mayo sauce to be on the side. Good thing we asked if it came with a sauce since it didnt' say on the menu. If your familiar with those pork buns you can get at he Asian Bakeries for $2, that's pretty much what it tasted like. Good but not worth $12. My boyfriend at the sandwich with the condiments on it and said that it didn't go well together at all. The chips are those kinds you get at the fair. However, just looking at them, you can tell that they were drenched in the cooking oil. They were so soggy and flimsy. How did the cook see that and think it looked appetizing? Another person got the duck sliders which came out 15 minutes later for some reason and the chips were just as soggy. Our meals didn't really come out at the same time but I guess I'd rather get it right away than have it sitting under a heat lamp. The fries that come with the burger are similar to those from Steak and Shake (thin-cut/shoe string fries). Those were probably the best thing out of the whole meal. I was told that the burgers were good. Our lemon chicken was horrible. I've never had to return something back to the kitchen before but it just wasn't good and not worth $20. It was really sour (not sweet and sour, just sour) and the chicken was really rubbery. The chicken was in little strips, I was expecting an actual piece of chicken breast that you usually get at restaurants.\n\nOur drinks sometimes went empty but other than that our waiter was really nice and accommodating. He didn't question that the monkey bread was raw or that we didn't like our dish. \n\nI don't think any of us will ever go back. There are just too many other options in Old Town that are so much better. What a shame.\n\nGot a message from Jake J. probably someone who has a share in the restaurant since he posted those professional photos. An average diner wouldn't have access to those. Here's what he's got to say: \""Got love the complainers. They always have yelp accounts. I had to write once I saw your review. Monkey bread is my favorite and it is not raw in the middle it is melted cheese. Figured you would know that with your advanced pallet or see it with your own eyes. Can't please everyone. Ive been there so many times never had one complaint nor heard one around me until this stupid site that have so called \""wanna be food critics\"" didn't momma teach u anything..... If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. Guess not. Typical \""yelper\""\"" Funny because he has written unfavorable reviews in the past, some even promoting Sevens'.

2,"Another \""do-it-yourself\"" bridal shop with rows of dresses tightly packed on racks in big plastic bags.   The woman was super quick swapping out the dresses in the room.  As soon as I walked out in a new dress, she had the old one out and the new one ready to go and waiting for me in my room.  I might have rated this store a bit higher, but I didn't seem to have any luck here.  Dresses were either way too big or way too small and I just didn't find any that I liked.  I have heard of many people having success here and the prices are reasonable, just didn't work for me.  The dress shopping continues. . .",50838

3,"CPR re-certification is just something you have to do as a healthcare professional.  We all moan and groan about it because there are a hundred other things you'd rather be doing for 3hrs. \nHowever, I've been going to Heart Savers for quite a few years now and they have managed to streamline their system pretty well. When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix. \nThe instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category. \nThe hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.\n Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually.\nThose of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years!\nOne note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.  But I heard cheaper rates being quoted in class, as well as higher ones (you pay once you get to class).",536287
2,"This restaurant is really cool...worth visiting just to see the setting/decor. If you are inside the Caesar Palace or in the vicinity and want chinese food, go to this place instead of the chinese place at the Forum food court. The food is pretty good. The specialty item is the handpull noodle with different topping, with the pork/mushroom as being the most popular. I did try that and was happy with it. I do eat in the San Gabriel valley a lot and I think this place is pretty good. The food cost anywhere from $9-$30 per dish, which is still cheaper than any other sit down chinese restaurants at the Bellagio, The Aria, or the Wynn. Red 8 at the Wynn is probably the best casual asian/chinese in the casino though.",369195
0,"Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \""multiple times\"" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \""Oh, you wanted another?\"" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer.

Be sure to check out the Clearance sections in every department (or, you know, don't so I can snatch up all the finds).\n\nI am, however, pretty sure that the parking deck of this Target is the national headquarters for driving like an asshole.  It's like someone purposely filled the place with inept and rude drivers. The main level is usually packed anyway so i tend to park down a level and just take the stairs. Infinitely less infuriating.",293206

0,"DIRTY.  Dirty, dirty, dirty.   I was excited to have a corner suite at Aria, but I sat on my couch and pulled a pair of dirty women's underwear out from under a couch cushion.  Then, in the awesome bathroom, I dropped my hairbrush on the floor, and when I bent down to get it, there were 4 Xanax on the floor, under the vanity.  Neither of the above items were mine; we had just checked in.  I asked to change rooms and a room upgrade, and they told me that would be difficult.  They put an equal room on hold for me, but I couldn't get into it until 6pm the FOLLOWING day.   Really more of a hassle to move rooms.  Then, later in my stay, as I was walking from the shower to my room, I sliced the bottom of my foot open on a carpet staple/nail that was loose.  Hurts like hell.   Since I had already officially \""checked out\"" online early that morning, they wouldn't do anything about that.   For all of this, in a 48 hour stay, after talking with the management for a day and a half, they finally offered me a $100 credit on anything inside the hotel.  $100 does not buy 1 show ticket, or 1 spa treatment.  I still had to spend more money there.   I could not use $100 on food, since I was at a work conference. Some BS if you ask me.  I will not return to the Aria, would not recommend it, and will not stay there next year, if the conference is there again.",375619

3,"Saw all the great reviews on Yelp and had to try this place. We were very happy we did! So close to home and love the neighborhood pizzeria feel. Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage and garlic, 3 cheese Stromboli and garlic knots....OMG the garlic knots!!! They were fluffy pillows of buttery, garlicky goodness that not only smelled good but made our mouths water as their wonderful aroma filled the air around us. The pizza was BETTER than the NYC pizza I had in NYC and made me feel good knowing I don't have to travel 3000 miles to get amazing pizza. The crust was thin, crisp and chewy, sauce was perfect, cheese is good quality and toppings very generous. We will definitely be back and spread the word. Thanks to Yelp we saved 50% off our pizza order just for checking in today between 2-5pm.",553177

I've been here twice.  Once I got an apple salad that left me still hungry (I think it's meant of more of an appetizer than an entree), the other time I got the Classique steak (my husband and I share the appetizers of the mac&cheese, and sweet potato soup), everything was \""just okay.\""  Big portions but ordinary tastes.  \n\nThe bread was amazing through, and bread is important to me!

1,"Wanted to like this, but no. For a bit of background, my husband is half Lebanese and we've eaten our fair share of Middle Eastern food of all stripes and varieties. For really good Middle Eastern food in that part of the city, try Fatoush. Little hole in the wall run by an Iraqi man (I think).\n\nAnyways, this place. Honestly the only reason it gets 2 stars is because hubby liked several of the dishes that I didn't try, like the kafta. First of all, when we ordered water to go with the meal, they brought us bottled water and then charged us for it. EVERY other restaurant I've ever been to in my life has either correctly assumed that I wanted a glass of water, or asked me to clarify whether I wanted bottled water or not. When the waitress turned up a few minutes later, we asked for glasses of water. After she conferred with someone in the back, we got glasses of lukewarm tap water- with no ice.\n\nAnd then, the food. Granted, at a Mediterranean buffet, I expect mostly Mediterranean food, but here even that was too much to ask. Of the four buffet tables full of food, maybe one and a half was food I would have considered Mediterranean, and even some of that was a stretch. Some of the dishes in the buffet included: lasagna (looked frozen), alfredo (gummy and bland), pasta with chicken (just strange), zucchini fries (obviously frozen), fried okra (?), spring rolls (frozen), orange Jell-o squares (huh?). The rice pilaf was too salty and had Jalapeno peppers in it(?). As for the actual Mediterranean food, the stuffed grape leaves were the best of the bunch. As I mentioned, hubby liked the kafta but it was a bit spicy for me. The hummus was bitter- too much tahini. The chicken schwarma tasted like someone tried to alter a recipe for chicken parmesan. Really, the best section overall was the salads. The tabbouleh was decent although it needed more salt to counteract all of the lemon juice. And one other salad had huge chunks of feta cheese in it- the feta was strong and flavorful.\n\nOverall, there is NO way I'd go back here, even with another Groupon.",559626

3,"Absolutely beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright  inspired hotel where every President since Herbert Hoover has stayed (Obama has yet to make an appearance). We chose to stay in the Octavilla building. Yes, it's far from the parking lot (hence the minus one star) but the rooms are new and spacious - accented with the signature Biltmore blocks in the bathroom and in the headboard. Breakfast at Frank & Alberts was delicious with  organic, locally grown ingredients included on the menu.  Definitely take the time to explore the grounds and the buildings and ask the concierge to sign you up for the historical tour where you can learn about all the amazing architecture and well-known guests and traditions at the Biltmore. To think that the piano in the lobby has been played by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Billy Joel, and Bono! Tip: carry a map of the hotel with you - it's very easy to get lost!",389287

I was actually uncomfortable from being so full. I would like to emphasize again that this really doesn't happen very often for me. The food was good, nothing crazy-awesome, but good.

They're totally addicting and I always end up buying things I shouldn't, or at least didn't intend to.\n\nSo, as a concept I really like Real Foods. It's just this location which gives me the case of the 3 stars, and that's in comparison to the Broughton St location.\n\nIt's *very* cramped, so much that whenever I paused to peruse the shelves I found I was in someone's way. I have found stocking to be a bit hit or miss as well, struggling to find exactly what I'm looking for when I know they carry it. \n\nOne of the beauties of a store like this is that you wander around and find new an unusual things to spend/waste your money on - the setup here doesn't encourage that at all. Good for my wallet I guess, but not so good for the business. \n\nMost recently I came in to buy gift certificates - these can be bought online but if you DO buy them online, you can only use them online. What?  What a strange and inconvenient system. Anyway, so I went to the store to buy them and they're actually kept in the back room somewhere so I had a reasonably extended wait while someone went to fetch these.

Bad idea.\n\nEverything was dipped in butter before hitting the hot griddle also, I couldn't help but notice the filthy supposed-to-be-white uniforms everyone was wearing. Inmates have cleaner clothes.\n\nBecause this was in a mall, it was extremely busy and it took a while before the food made its way to us and even getting a refill was difficult. \n\nI do like the 50s music and liked singing along obnoxiously.

It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.\n\nEveryone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry.

As you walk in they have a few pre-made salads and in my made up place they would make your salad with the items you like and mix it along with your dressing selection in a bowl for you.  They have enough toppings to make your salad and a good variety of salad dressings.  They offer hot pasta items, muffins, bread, focaccia bread, soups, fruits and frozen yogurt.  I may have missed a few items but am painting a decent enough picture for the folks who never been to a Sweet Tomatoes.  I would like to see smaller batches of ingredients out on the salad bar with more frequent replenishment to ensure the freshest items are out all the time, again this is a item I would do in my made up salad bar.

3,"So I stayed at Encore last year for CES and the place had just opened. Didn't have a great experience. They lost my luggage the first night when I left it with the bell boy, checking out was a nightmare, ordering food and having basic things in the room (like a pen) proved too difficult... but I must say they redeemed themselves this year.\nI stayed in the tower suites this time around for CES and would highly recommend it. The suite is huge... 2 bathrooms, a massage room, living room, bedroom... way more space than I needed. The staff were very sweet, the concierge was great with reservations and checking out was very easy. The separate entrance is key if you don;t have a limo because it makes getting a cab much easier (and you avoid the ludicrous lines that exist at the main casino entrance) and check out is much faster. \nThe gym fee is a little ridiculous but that's just standard Vegas so it's not specific to Wynn/Encore.  \nLast thing -  one day the maid threw out bags that I had left in the middle of my bathroom... she thought they were trash. Except they contained the shoe bags and receipts from several pairs of beautiful new shoes I had bought. She threw them out by accident. Obviously I was pissed... but they were very professional dealing with it and went back the store and sent up 5 sets of Louboutin and Sergio Rossi covers after they realized what had happened (and who am I kidding... I wasn't going to return the things :) Throwing out the bags - not cool - but the way they dealt with it was very professional and very much appreciated. \nOverall, I like Encore more than Wynn and it is definitely one of my go to hotels when i go to Vegas.",321796

You can always buy a burrito and a taco supreme then put them together and make your own jumbo size burrito supreme. Yeah, that's a J Monday special.....haha! \nLocation wise - it's very convenient.

We did ask for it not to be as spicy and they accommodated us, which was nice. It was just enough kick for us. TRY THAT! She also recommended the equivalent dish, but with lamb. Next time I'd like to taste test that one. \n\nThe fried pork ribs were just normal. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. We also got a veggie dish. We always ask what kind of veggies they have. Sometimes they have ones that aren't on the menu. \n\nAll this filled the 6 of us and was pretty reasonable in price. \n\nI liked the service. I mean really, I never go to a Chinese restaurant expecting good service. I just look forward to the food. But the lady gave us her recommendations. We were hesitant on the fish dish (bc we weren't sure if it'd be too spicy), and she told us to get the lunch portion vs the dinner since it was smaller and if we didn't like it, we wouldn't have as much. That was cool. \n\nIf you like spicy, I'm sure this place would fill your tank.

2,"Stadium is in the heart of downtown, surrounded by hotels.  Parking is different because of space and location.  Parking lot fees vary from $10 to $50.  If you are lucky on game day to find a lot with vacancies, otherwise go online and reserve a spot for $15.00.  Some lots guarantee security and restrooms and an attendant all day.  Now the stadium adheres to all of the newest NFL guidelines pertaining to what you can bring into the stadium.  Ladies were turned away because they had larger than regulation purses.  Those of you with seat cushions read the guidelines.  Diaper bags, another no no.  Parents were instructed to return to their vehicle and only bring what was necessary.  Food concessions was a big disappointment.  Bogangles were all over the place.  Other sports complexes over a superior variety, and your choices were limited here.  Was disappointed, since the web site had limited ticket availability, and yet there were way to many empty seats.  Before and after the game the city police are controlling traffic.

There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). \n\nWe started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible.

The bar was clean and our server, even though she was new, did well taking care of us.  Everyone at the table had either tap or bottled beer, except me, and had no complaints.\n\nI had a 65th anniversary special margarita.  It was big and refreshing... It also cost $10!  Was it worth ten bucks? No! But it was far better than the $7 margarita made with crappy booze... But I only had one as I find the cost highly prohibitive.\n\nThe table shared a plate of deep fried green chili strips off the Chili Harvest menu and they were quite good.  I don't like that they were fried... I think of frying as something one does when they don't have the skills to appropriately showcase the flavor of the item... But they were still good!\n\nThe biggest complaint at the table was the fact that there was no tangible happy hour offering... They once had a happy hour food spread, but not today... They had half price appetizers off the regular menu (the seasonal menu was not included)... But no buffet... Why?  \n\nDrinks and a happy hour buffet are why we were there, now there is little reason to return...",251681
1,"Eh...  \n\nMaybe this place is just too sophisticated for my palate.\n\nHubby and I came here for lunch last Monday.  I ordered the Shabu style Hot and Sour soup with tofu, and hubby ordered the sugar cane pork spare ribs and chili lime beef.\n\nThe soup was alright, but not very substantial.  It came with a variety of vegetables, some japanese vegetable I cannot even begin to spell, mushrooms, baby corn, and tomatoes.  I must admit, the hot house tomatoes sort of threw me off.  Because it said Shabu style, i had envisioned something more, more noodles and tofu for dipping perhaps?  Anyway, I definitely would not order that dish again.\n\nThe chili lime beef was actually a beef carpaccio, more lime than chili.  Not that I have anything against carpaccio, but there was nothing on the menu to indicate it would be carpaccio style, and I feel like that is something you should disclose.  \n\nThe sugar cane pork definitely stole the show.  They were tangy and sweet, and extremely tasty.  However one winner out of three just isn't enough to make me want to come back.",351500
3,"Best, most authentic Italian ever?  Well, perhaps not.  Dang good, dang unhealthy Americanized Italian?  Yes, indeed.\n\nOk, people... if you're going to a place named \""Mama Ricotta's,\"" you shouldn't be expecting it to be terribly authentic.  But it is much better than Olive Garden.  The food is horrible for you, but delicious.  On our first visit, I had the tortellini special, which really impressed me.  The little pastas were perfectly cheesy, and the meat sauce was amazing.  It actually had little chunks of steak in it instead of ground beef.  My mouth is watering as I write this review, honestly.\n\nThe only part of the experience that was less than ideal was the goat cheese appetizer.  It came highly recommended, and it was tasty, but it lacked tanginess.  I probably wouldn't have been as let down if my expectations had not been so high.\n\nMama Ricotta's is comfort.  Good ol' Americanized comfort.  Mmm.",7161
3,"Man, they need more of these all over the place.  When I lived in San Diego, the closest was about an hour and a half away.  Now that I live in San Jose, the closest is an hour and a half away!  Thank God my parents live in Las Vegas now.  Everytime I go to visit, I try and make a stop over here.  Their menu is like no other fast food joint.  It's kind of like Jack In The Box, but better.  And their drinks, wow, what a selection!  My favorite is this orange drink that tastes exactly like a 50/50 bar.  Now, that's good stuff!",72354
2,"Yeah, it's a chain but it's still one of the best bets for barbeque in the city. Better, in my opinion, than Memphis Championship BBQ but not as good as Lucille's.The food is consistently good and you get plenty of it for the money. 1/2 slab of ribs, corn, cornbread, and two sides for $12. You'll leave satisfied. All the other menu items I've tried in the past have been solid. On Monday's kids eat for $0.99 with the purchase of a regular entree. The service at this location was a little slow last time we went, but usually they're pretty dependable.",359906
0,"I typically don't write bad reviews about places unless they reAlly did something to upset me. Koi pretended that it was $20 for open bar . We had one man with us and he got kicked out when he tried to order a drink past midnight. \n\nThis place is horrible and they will make a scene about what they offer you outside the  \""club\"". I put the word club in parenthesis because this place calls themselves a club but its far from it.",292435
2,Salsa! Baby! I love the salsa at Baja Fresh. They are always...I guess...fresh. It is your typical Mexican restaurant like a Taco Bell but way better. The restaurant is nice and clean. They have outdoor seating that you can enjoy if the weather is nice. The selections are decent and you can count on quality food.,268517
3,"I don't gamble, and if I do it's like $100. I'm the type of Asian guest that the Palazzo doesn't want, and they do cater to Asians since over 80% of the whales and hi-rollers are Asian. That's why you'll be properly accommodated if you want to watch Korean, Chinese, and Japanese TV shows (I hope they have Viet channels cuz Viets sure do throw down big money in Vegas).\n\nI only have some small issues with the Palazzo because after all, it's supposed to be a 5-star hotel?\n\nPROS:\n- Overall big spacious rooms (everybody's reviews below spells out the specifics).\n\nCONS:\n- The design of the Palazzo is very middle-of-the road, and it doesn't take the themed gimmick route like the Venetian, New York New York, Paris, Excalibur, etc. Instead, they've designed a fairly lackluster interior that's very forgettable. Even the lobby seems indistinctly tucked away into one side of the main rotunda which can be overlooked if you're not paying attention.\n- The management was gracious enough to let us check-in early since we got in prior to 3pm, but I don't know if room service would have put the finishing touch on everything, but I noticed a bunch of annoying details:\n  1. the lamp fixture in the bathroom was tilted, and it needed to be straightened out.\n  2. Small gripe, but when someobody's in the bathroom frantically spinning the toilet paper roll, you can hear it while your laying in the bed. This could take a toll on having \""sweet dreams\"".... I imagine dreams of trying to balance yourself atop a log while cruising down a river of chocolate... yea chocolate.\n  3. Design wise, the door knob they decided to use on the doors is deceiving because I had a friend say \""there's somebody in the bathroom\"" because they couldn't turn the handle thinking it was locked. Instead, you just have to pull on the door - either you're a moron, or it's intuitively ingrained in us to turn a handle. \n  4. Like the Se Hotel in San Diego, there's a gap in the bathroom door which is a huge perverted plus because they also don't have a lock on the doors. So if you have female guests, they'll have to barricade the doors if they can't trust you. My friend didn't shower.\n  5. It would have been nice to use the refrigerator in the room, but any sort of movement in the mini-bar would have resulted in additional room charges. Not to mention, the ice bucket they provide you is extremely tiny. \n  6. The bell check didn't bother helping us with any of our luggage when we drove up!?! They only assisted the people getting out of the taxi cabs. What's up with that? I know they don't offer valet, but isn't this the simplest thing they could do because it set the tone for the remainder of our stay.\n  7. Out of the 3 bathrooms, the bathroom TV wouldn't turn off, and it also didn't have the same channels as the other two?! So we couldn't find the shows we were watching on the other two.\n\nOverall it was a decent stay on NYE at the Palazzo because the rooms are so spacious which is great for hosting a bunch of your friends prior to going out. I bet Chinese New Year would be even better in Vegas. Maybe, I'll have to get a room number with 8's in it and take up gambling.... well Happy New Year!",292711
1,"Came here last night for a friends bachelor party.  I wasn't that impressed with the club in comparison to XS.  Basically, one level is all booths and the next level is the dance floor (but was kind of like a maze trying to get around the joint).   They had a local dj playing, so nothing great, they might have gotten an extra star if they had a better dj playing.  I just think the overall design blew, plus the drinks were crazy expensive, but that's expected at any club in Vegas.  Would I go here again?  Hell no!!  XS or Marquee is the only way to go in Vegas, just my 2 cents!",597210
0,"Bland, blech, barf. \n\nThat's pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger. The food here is the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venturing into Lean Cuisine territory. I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!) \n\nI think I gave it a fair shake. I ate here a total of four times, with different people and different food. I was not impressed once. In fact, I was pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weaving itself through my molded mound of rice. \n\nNo spice. No life. No business from me.",13308
4,I started going to Hand N Stone @ Tatum & Cactus almost 6 years ago and plan to continue. Evey one there has always made me feel very comfortable and  special. I have never had a bad massage and I get who ever is available. Love this place,402384
4,"Federal pizza had become our favorite pizza place of all time. \n\nThe Casanova is a unique and surprising blend of flavors, it tempts us every time! And, with their Monday/Tuesday specials and the super convenient drive-thru...you can't beat it!!",577796
4,"Just reviewing this club is distracting me enough to lead me off into a hangover daydream... Las Vegas is it's own party bubble atmosphere and XS is definitely one of the highlights of that party. The serene, elegant, lavish, sexy, and bold environment and decor are both refreshing and exciting. It is one of the most spacious and welcoming clubs in LV with a wide indoor dancefloor, VIP seating, and luxurious high ceilings with chandeliers that sparkle with the lighting. But wait until your bright doey eyes behold the outdoor patio equipped with a full poolside bar, beautifully lit, large pool, a lovely nightsky view, and even more space to shake that thang!!! The crowd is a mix of happy party-goers, mostly young in age having a good time. I haven't been there when the pool is open, but I'm excited for that on my next trip.\n\nI don't know how much cover is, but I'm sure it's worth it for the people that have to pay. However, tip for the girls: Talk to the random promoters along the strip because they can get you into clubs (including XS) for free through the guestlist! We even got a few guys in for free. So make sure you spread your social butterfly wings and make friends in Vegas because it pays off! I went to the bar earlier so its wasn't too hard to get a drink, but I saw that it got crowded later in the night, so be prepared. The danclefloor in and out are spacious enough and built in a way to prevent too much cramping and crowding, which is a plus. The bouncers/security are generally nice and helpful, especially considering the crazies and drunks they have to deal with... one of my friends had to be \""politely escorted\"" out.. haha. \n\nXS is definitely one of the lovely gems of Las Vegas, so make sure you show some love and dance moves and pay it a visit. The 5 star ratings speak for themselves! It's definitely a good time baby!",365676
1,"Went back second time...service so, so.  Order mixed drink tall,  came small... ordered chips with Guacamole...no Guacamole served...ordered plain chicken wings...no favor and not crisp like last time.

1,"It's a little place I think over in terminal A next to the only brewery bar in the airport. The service was good but I didn't like my sweet Italian sausage. It came in a warm bun with peppers and onion. There are so many other places in the airport that are better for the price. This sweet sausage cost with tax, $6.50ish.",284938
1,"I'm really not a fan of this place. The interior is outdated and gave me the feeling that the place should be steam cleaned. The tables weren't very comfortable either. \n\nThe menu had a good number of options, especially if you are a big lamb-eater (which I am not). \n\nDesserts were pretty good and maybe worth visiting for, however the main course was worth passing.",80335
4,"I don't hand out five stars often - but in this case, I think they are warranted.  We can't say anything bad about this place.\n\nThe food is not typical Italian - it's Italian, but with a South Philadelphia flair.  Everything was very good - I don't know how much else I can say.  The tomatoes in the Caprese tasted like tomatoes.  The cheese (both Mozzarella and Ricotta) are made in house.  The meatball is to die for.  The desserts were good.\n\nOur waiter, Ben, was as good as they come - really - his service made our experience perfect.",435196
0,I went for a nice meal tonight and wound up with a rather bad experience. I first sat in the bar and got a drink. After watching the bartender cater to a group of five while I sat alone and waited 10 minutes for a menu I decided to sit somewhere else in the main dining room.  Kevin then served me. Everything was fine until a party of eight showed up and then he could care less about me and did not show up but once every 20 minutes. Of course when he did come by he wanted to know if I wanted another $20 glass of wine to pump up the bill.  Stay away from this place because the servers just want to make their money on the big parties. And my tip to Kevin showed it. I have been known to tip a lot. Usually 50%. But not tonight and I will not go back. Typical West Coast environment. Short term,190521
2,"Billed as the #1 Hit Music Station, KISS FM is on my regular rotation when flipping through the channels.  \n\nIt's a radio station that I can only handle in small bursts....if I listen to it too long, I feel like I'm Bill Murray in Groundhog's Day.  It's very predictable and you are guaranteed to hear a song come on at least 4 times per hour.\n\nThe music they play are the top songs on the charts, so it's not too bad most of the time.  Just like any other station, I tune out as soon as a DJ starts yapping.  I listen to the radio for the music.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",249011
2,"Certainly a decent option if you are looking for a healthy alternative to all the fast food places nearby. Pizza was good, not great. Salads were a bit underwhelming. The descriptions on the menu are better than the actual item.\nSpace is nice enough, better for lunch than dinner.",251294
0,Bad bad experience... Got sold on a hand car wash to clean the mud from underneath. Came out with mud still caked on... And... They lost my antenna.. Why would you need to take the antenna off if you were going to hand wash it!!??? Save your obey.. Go the 5$ wash.,46414
2,Overall good food. I really enjoy the Bacon Double Dell Burger and chicken soft tacos.,433182
4,"I've made several trips to Indonesia over the years and this is the first place in the States that serves food comparable to the fare I had there..

My other rooms get less traffic, and did not need cleaning, since I have been doing my almost daily vacuuming that Eddie suggested last visit.  Daniel and Eduardo came out this time, and there was a call when they were on their way.  They were fair with the pricing as well, since I thought that I had more stairs then I quoted, they adjusted the price, I also received a Yelp discount.  The carpets came out nice, as before, but there was a little less customer service (i.e. no shoe covers, no suggestions for maintenance), but all in all, will be calling again when needed.",221936
0,"I REALLY wanted to love this place...but it did not go well.  I never noticed this restaurant although it is right next door to my favorite burrito spot (Super Burrito).  When I arrived they were plenty of people pulling into the drive thru.  Since I couldn't figure out what to order, I went inside.  The staff was cordial.  I decided to keep it simple and ordered a traditional burrito.  I was so excited!  I got home and bit into it and \""crunch\""!  I tried again..more crunch!  Broken egg shells in my burrito!   Needless to say I lost my appetite.  I called to let them know I was bringing the burrito back and no I didn't want anything else (they offered).  Although they were very apologetic, I'm just not sure I can bring myself back to trying something else.  D'lish was a D'isappointment :(  Maybe I'll give the new Tempe location a try *sigh*.",240777
1,"Here's the grade detail -\n\nFood - Minus 2 stars. We had the scallop appetizer and it was great. The chicken was BOILED, and then browned  very briefly on the grill. THe shrimp fried rice was meh, although the veggie fried rice was pretty good (they were about a 1/3 cup serving each). The maitake with truffle butter was absolutely delicious (about 5 mushrooms), the steak was just ok. The bok choy was very VERY good. The portions were miniscule. The fingerlng potatoes were literally TWO potatoes, halved. For desert we had a flavored creme brulee, or at least they called it creme brulee. I like my creme brulee to have a crisp candy coating, and whatever flavor you add should not turn the custard consistency to that of coffee grounds, but according to them, it was creme brulee and who am I to argue?\n\nPrice - Minus 2 stars. $10 for the two fingerling potatos. $30 for the boiled chicken. And $20 PER OUNCE for the steak. Don't make me do math!!!! just price the damn thing $80 or $100 and be done with it.. Making me decide how many ounces to pay for (and watching you weigh it out!!!!) is just nickle and diming me. It just feels petty. \n\nHow about a prix fixe menu? Since you've only got a few things to choose from anyway?\n\nStaff - Plus 1 star. They were really nice and friendly and helpful. And you're not giving them much to work with, so I really hope you pay them well.\n\nBoiled chicken, FFS. Ugh. I feel like deducting another star just from the thought of it. But I won't.\n\nThe bottom line, $400 with tip. And I had to eat dinner again a couple of hours later.",567742
4,"The Costco of pet supplies :-) except that you do not need to pay annual membership fees like you would at C or Sam's Club.

My daughter said \""I am not even a dog and I'm having fun looking at so much dog stuff\"" ;-)\nAlso lots of cat supplies too.\nThe prices are great.

1,"I recently ate dinner at Hamada of Japan. The food itself is good, but I have to point out that the average tab here is NOT $25 per person, as the Flamingo's website states. If you order from the off of the teppan grill menu, entrees cost more like $80. Very deceiving!\n\nAnyway, now that you know that, feel free to eat here. It's not a bad place to eat. I only ordered sushi, which was decent. Not the best I ever had, but OK.\n\nAnother thing to note is that this place doesn't have a full bar - beer and wine only. Annoying! WTF!?!? I thought this was Vegas! How can you not have a full bar?!?!\n\nService is OK. A little slow. The hibachi guys are really great and entertaining. \n\nHonestly, I don't know if I would go here again.

3,"I visited this area for the first time in March 2014 with my family. We were just experiencing the city and not looking for anything specific. All of us loved it, young and old. We loved the little shops, especially Pittsburgh Popcorn Factory, Art of Steel, the European market, various street vendors and the biscotti shop. Even if you fasted, you wouldn't be able to try it all in one day. \n\nThere are tons of food options from snacks to sit down restaurants. If I was local I would have such a great time experiencing all of the local wonders and flavors as well as take advantage of the fresh produce market which had incredibly low prices. \n\nI wish they'd close off the roadways in peak hours. There isn't much room to move on the sidewalks but there is also traffic so it's a struggle to get around, especially with a stroller. I wish there was a little more variety in shops because I can see it getting old year after year if there isn't variation.",319691

0,"I've given this place a try on 3 different occasions since it seems to get such great reviews.  The first time  I went, I ordered the tenderloin, medium cooked.  They overcooked the steak the first shot, so I sent it back.  The second shot was WAY undercooked, but I didn't send it back again.\n\nThe second time I went for lunch, I ordered the steak sandwich.  I ordered it medium, yet once again it was undercooked.  I didn't send it back because the people I was with kept on telling me how good a restaurant it was, and so I didn't send it back because I didn't want them to look bad..  So instead, I choked down my undercooked steak sandwich.\n\nThis last time I ordered the scallops.  They did not taste fresh at all.  Over $30 for 3 fishy tasting scallops????\n\nThis place has a stuffy atmosphere and horrible food.  I will never go back.",219432
3,"I enjoyed both of my meals at Mix. The view is spectacular, the prices are about par for the course in terms of nice dining in Las Vegas. I expected a bit more given the Ducasse association, but the dining experience is quite good and (almost) worth the price. Just a few comments:\n\n-The lobster Casear salad is way too big and totally out of keeping with the portion size of just about everything else on the menu. It can easily be shared by two folks.\n\n-I found that the meat dishes (duck, beef, and pork) outshined the seafood alternatives. I am particularly fond of the artisan pasta with duck appetizer -- a must-do for all duck lovers.\n\nWine list features plenty of good wine by the glass options. I also love the fact that you can get truffles on just about every dish.",264663

IT'S SO FAR.\"" In reality - a $30 cab ride split between 4 of us was WELL worth it. \n\nDelicious food. Our waitress was very attentive. Our chef was hilarious, easygoing, fun, and obviously a great cook.\n\nDefinitely try the shrimp tempura roll... one of the best I've had. And for Hibachi I recommend the shrimp, any of the steaks, and the fried rice. I wasn't really a fan of the chicken though... a bit dry for my liking.\n\nLove, love, love this place.",532064
1,Walked in on a Friday night and waited for someone to decide to help us. Lots of staff just walked by till finally someone came and helped us. There were visably at least 5 or 6 available tables but still we were told a 30-45 minute wait? really? we went across the street and got a table right away. This place is pretty but that seems about it all it has to offer.,609606
2,"So the Monte Carlo has recently been renovated. This hotel is a great moderately priced hotel and the renovations make it look a little nicer than it did before. \n\nThe hotel is pretty central strip. It's in between Aria and New York and right across from MGM. The hotel is pretty nice and the staff is good. We had no problems checking in or out. \n\nThere was one problem in that we had our do not disturb sign on the door all weekend but when we came back from a pool party on saturday we came into the room and one bed had been made. First, we had the do not disturb sign on because we didn't really need the room cleaned. Second, if someone was coming into the room to clean it, I would have locked my things up in my suitcase. This was a minor problem with us. because we didn't want our things being gone through which is why we had the sign up. But it appears that the sign was ignored. \n\nOther than that, it's a nice hotel. It's not the Bellagio but it's not Harrah's. It's a nice room that is in between the two in regards to luxury.",162906

2,"Think of the Sugar Factory as a beddazzled Cheesecake Factory on steroids. It's got a large menu with just about everything on it. But, I can't tell you if it's good or bad because I only stopped by for a couple sweet treats with the family.\n\nThis place is actually broken up into four sections. The Sugar Factory American Brasserie is for dining, either indoors or on their patio overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountains. The Sugar Factory Chocolate Lounge is a more intimate space with sweets and drinks. The Outdoor Caf\u00e9, located right on the Strip, is a small outdoor counter serving up sandwiches, ice cream, gelato and other sweets. Finally, the Sugar Factory retail shop is the place to get sweets and merchandise (similar to their other shops around the Strip).\n\nThe retail shop was sensory overload -- not only with the desserts, cookies, ice cream, and gelato, but also with all the crap, I mean merchandise, to buy. Plus, the place was packed with tourists. Not the place to be if you hate crowds (as I do). We purchased three items (for around $12) and found a small, quiet 4 seat counter near the Chocolate Lounge to relax.\n\nThe wife got a peanut butter cookie that she called average (and not enough peanut butter). The kid got a small cup of chocolate ice cream, which he loved. He's 3, so of course he wasn't picky about his ice cream.\n\nI went with a key lime cupwich. It's a great -- albeit old -- concept that I'm surprised hasn't caught on with more cupcake shops. They take the bottom half of the cake portion of the cupcake and put it on top of the icing, making a sandwich. I'm a huge fan of the concept. Their version allows for a better icing-to-cake ratio and is easier to eat than most cupcakes. It looked beautiful with additional icing garnishing the top, along with a sugar-made flower and some sprinkles. It had a strong key lime flavor without being too tart. Unfortunately, the cake part was dry. \n\nI'd possibly come back to try other sweets. Maybe even the food. But, if you just want desserts I'd recommend heading to Jean Philippe Patisserie at Aria or Bellagio before this place.",504446
3,"Stopped in today after church, clean, upbeat environment.   First time here, so we asked about their most popular sandwiches.  Definitely gave a great recommendation - I went with the #9 Italian Night Club w/ hot peppers.  Good amount of meat, and other condiments.  Peppers gave it a nice little kick, even picked up a bag of their Jalapeno Potato Chips.  My only complaint is I wish the sandwich was a little bigger, it was gone, but I wanted to keep eating because it was so good.   \n\nFed a family of 4 for about $20, which isn't too bad.

2,Food isn't that good. Don't know why people love it so much. The customer service is okay but they are quite and don't really talk. My favorite thing is the ice tea wow it's amazing! But other then that it's cool. An upgraded KFC with not  a lot of stuff on the menu.,524389
0,"Until the owners get the quality of the pizza back up to where it once was I decided to try one of their pasta dishes and ordered the lasagna last week. At $11.75 I expected better.\n\nAccording to the menu it's served with bread, butter, and salad. The lasagna itself was uneventful and dry with no where near enough sauce. Basically it appeared as unseasoned plain browned hamburger meat and some cheese wrapped like a burrito with the pasta, sauce, some more cheese, and baked in a foil bowl no where near long enough to even heat it thoroughly and melt the cheeses. \n\nThe bread appeared to be a sub roll, not toasted garlic bread like most Italian restaurants would serve. And they forgot the butter, which definitely would have helped get that dry bread down!\n\nThe salad consisted of a small container of prepackaged lettuce, shreaded cheese and black olives. And not the freshest I've encountered. And don't expect home made ranch dressing, again, prepackaged. Maybe I'll try another pasta dish in the future to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the spaghetti is better. \n\nSo this week I decided to try the hot wings. How hard can it be to screw up buffalo wings? Apparently it's pretty easy! The wing sauce was served on the side, which I liked, but whomever was manning the fryer left them in WAY too long and burnt them to a crisp! YUCK! I guess burnt chicken is better than raw chicken. And again, prepackaged ranch dressing. (Hint hint - Hidden Valley Ranch mix is available in a restaurant size. Just add butter milk and mayo and you're good to go!)\n\nI really wish these folks would get their quality control issues addressed. You can't cut corners in the restaurant business and expect to survive on your reputation alone. And that's the ONLY reason I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt.",328638

I go to UNLV and I used to come here often for lunch. The owners are really nice. They food is really flavorful. They try to change the entrees up as often as possible. There is always chicken tandoori, and Kheer, which is all that I need to make me happy. Sometimes they have Saag, and it's so delicious. The music is nice and the ambiance is very pleasant. They have vegan and vegetarian dishes and an assortment of appetizers that go really well with mint chutney. They also have fresh fruit and salad. It is well worth the ~$9.00.",143918

We started with a fish sharing board, which included mackerel, salmon, and I believe trout, along with eggplant slices and other vegetables. Very good starter. My date has this thing about haggis - he has toured all around the UK and tries it wherever it's offered. The verdict was a decent haggis, which I tasted (off the bucket list). I had the chicken wrapped in Parma ham - \""dry\"" was my overall impression. Salads were good.\n\nThe alcohol solution was pretty positive. Innis and Gunn in the bottle, a nice brew indeed. Also very nice scotch. Glenkinchie was the special - loved it.\n\nThe service was polite but a little disorganized.\n\nI was surprised that two reviews were one star.

I had the chicken fried steak with eggs and hash browns.  My wife had the biscuits with gravy.  Both portions were big so they get an extra star for that.  The hash browns good and the biscuits tasted home made. \n\nI took 2 stars away for the seating. We sat right next to the kitchen door.  \n\nService was good.

If I could work, sleep and eat in a booth seat, I would die a happy man) so I am already getting excited.  Groovypucks and I take way too long looking at the menu and finally decide on our dishes (which we accompanied with a Thai Tea).

If I were to order it again, I would order it medium.\n\nGroovy got a Peanut and Chicken dish (#35) with onions and peppers.  I tried a bit, as I am comfortable in my sexuality, and I really liked it.  It was Damn good! That's right, Capital D!

It's just a middle class hotel, really, and if that's what you want and the Luxor is offering a good rate, then go for it.

1,"My family got treatments here this weekend and it was a lovely spa. The check in staff was nice enough but we were informed upon checking in that tips were already included on our bills and we couldn't remove them. This kind of turned us off and we inquired about canceling our appointments... they have a 2 day cancellation policy which I think is excessive. So basically we were forced to tip our technicians the amount that MGM wanted them to be tipped, which I didn't think was all that awesome.\n\nThe spa is split into a men's and women's spa but all of the treatment rooms are shared - private, but shared between the two spas. They're well appointed with steam rooms and a large jacuzzi for each one. My dad got a deep tissue and said it was absolutely fantastic. My sister and I got manicures that were good but not worth the $160. We got them on Saturday and it's Tuesday and my polish has almost entirely chipped off! My tech used Seche Vite for the top coat so I know it wasn't that, but she had the balls to dilute the polish she was using on my nails with acetone in front of me... something that makes polish chip. For $160 mani/pedis I thought that was a really crummy way to handle your materials. My technician was sweet though and the actual manicure and pedicure were good. Just bring your own polish and know it's going to be overpriced. Overall I've had better for the steep price but I'd probably go back.",185198

Ribs have just the right amount of mesq/hick smoke. Rib portions are proper, can stand alone w/o sauce, and well priced (avg $2.00 per bone). Not a fan of the potato salad to much mayo, not enough sugar and mustard. Bacon added to the potato salad is alright.

We're appaled and would rather go elsewhere. Good luck to you.\"" We began to wonder if we should stay. We figured we would wait a while longer. After all, it was Valentines Day, where else are we going to get seated at the last minute?\nAbout 15 minutes went by, and no one came to greet us, and there were 2 empty tables. I walked across the room near the kitchen entrance and told one of the employees we had been waiting over 20 minutes, and no one has even aknowledged our presence, and that we had a reservation. Their response was, \"" sorry, it's Valentines Day and we're short staffed.\"" I informed them that was not my problem, and at the very least someone could at least greet us & inform us that they're running behind. Again, the response was, \""Sorry, we're too busy.\"" At that point we left as the other couple behind us did the same.\n\nA week later, we decided to return for my birthday(after all, we had a free gift certificate to use). If I had trusted my instincts the first time, I would've left the certificate on Valentines Day for someone else to use.\nAfter we again waited 10 minutes before someone aknowledged we were even there, we were seated., We were brought a wine list and asked for our drink order.

1,"Such a large menu, which covers several different Asian cuisines, is always a red light to me. I really don't believe any kitchen can specialize in Tai, Chinese, Vietnamese AND Japanese cooking. Therefore I ordered sushi, fried tofu & hibachi. The sushi was really good; fresh & well-made. The hibachi was fine, a big plate of meat, rice & stir fried veggies, all fresh. \nThe fried food was inedible. My tofu was flavorless. I wanted a light, panko-battered dish served crispy and hot, sprinkled with fish flakes. I got lumps of lukewarm tofu rolled in corn meal, cooked off quickly and not even given a sprinkle of salt. My companion's fried softshell crabs were just as awful. Once again, flavorless, cold and definitely not fresh.\nI think this place could be successful if they specialized in the late night crowd--drunk and starving and looking to fill their bellies at 3 in the morning--because apart from the sushi,  Akahana is little more than an Asian Denny's.",495226

The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.\n\nThe food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights.",337877

I spent the last few minutes debating this review with my wife, who is absolutely convinced that Stick E Rice deserves 5 stars.\n\nThis restaurant has several strong points.

Every time I have come here, I have had the pleasure of being served by the same waitress, whose friendly greetings and smiles make me feel like a member of her family. The waitstaff is always on point, from timing courses well to clearing used dishes promptly. Drink refills are typically not an issue, unless you're only drinking water (but they never leave you wanting for a refill). The reason for this is that soft drinks are served ice cold in cans, accompanied by cold glasses filled with ice. I know that restaurants typically may profit more from serving soft drinks in cans, but I feel that better establishments provide fountain drinks with free refills.\n\nI ordered the potstickers as an appetizer, and they are VERY tasty and lack the excessive \""doughiness\"" served by so many other restaurants. I don't know if they're homemade, but I can tell you that surely you can't go wrong in placing an order for them.\n\nI typically order from the lunch special menu, so my meal is accompanied by a complimentary soup. The egg drop soup is tasty, and served in an attractive cup with a side of crispy chow mein \""chips.\"" I once had a rendition of the hot and sour soup, and I honestly have to say that it needs much work to resemble a true Chinese hot and sour soup.\n\nThe main courses are always flavorful. The portions may seem small, but upon finishing my order I am always very satisfied. The pepper steak, orange chicken, pad thai and mixed vegetable options are wonderful entrees. My wife's regular favorite entree is the \""mixed vegetables with added shrimp.\""\n\nYou simply must leave room for dessert!  Stick E Rice offers a dessert called \""Stick E Mango\"" that is absolutely a must-have! We order it every time we come here. Every time. The sticky rice is formed in sushi-sized pieces, and bear the almost banana-like sweetened flavor of coconut. Each order is seemingly bombarded with sliced mango! The mango has always been sweet and succulent; I have never had the unpleasantness of biting into a more green or hardened slice of mango. The mango is drizzled with a sweetened coconut \""caramel.\""\n\nI absolutely cannot fathom why anyone could possibly review Stick E Rice with less than a 3-star rating! Sure, the menu may not be perfectly Thai; this restaurant has more of a Thai-Chinese fusion offering, but this combination serves to offer its clientele more choices and even a more familiar option for the less brave. The menu is also somewhat customizable to personal taste and spiciness preference.\n\nTo maybe receive a 5-star rating:\n1. Serve fountain drinks with free refills. Even if free refills are not offered, at least, do not serve the soft drinks in cans! That's what I would expect at a home BBQ, not at a nicer restaurant. At a minimum, to preserve the appearance of \""freshness,\"" the soft drinks could be served in unopened, chilled glass bottles. I still prefer and strongly recommend the fountain drink option for cost effectiveness and \""friendliness\"" when serving very spicy food that may need to be frequently washed down.\n2. The restroom is very clean and spacious, but one must pass the register area and the doorway to the kitchen in order to access the restroom. I understand that this is a small business, but the area near the register should be kept clutter-free. I saw stacks of various papers, mail and other things which gave the appearance of an \""amateur\"" business. Clean that area up, especially if it's visible to clients. The kitchen is quite clean from what I could see. Then again, I shouldn't be able to see into the kitchen. Due to design limitations, a door is an unsafe option, but perhaps a sheer curtain or something may be put up to obscure the customer's view into the cooking area, and to somewhat muffle the noise coming from the kitchen into the dining area. I don't know what options are available, but that's not my job, is it?\n3. Move the music system to the back counter, out of sight.  At a minimum, hide the speaker wires or install some recessed or wireless speakers.\n4. Refine the menu more (i.e. hot and sour soup).",465375
1,"I like a menu that has limited choices. However, if you're menu is limited then what you make needs to be outstanding. Both of our burgers were dry as were the buns. The egg on my burger was over hard. In all my times of ordering a \""dirty\"" burger, I've never had the egg fried hard. The point of the egg is for the yolk to soak into the bun and run over the meat. The truffle fries were a miss with the sauce tasting more like an Alfredo. We ended up sending them back and asking for plain fries suggesting maybe they were soggy because they sat too long. Server was pleasant and the wine was good. We won't return.",572850
2,"I lived off Red Robin fries in college, but \""bottomless\"" is an understatement! Our waitress, once we hunted her down, would give us a basket of four--there were three of us!!!  \n\nI loved my great balls of fire burger (it was slathered in fried jalapenos!) and the freckled lemonade is delish. There are better Red Robins: Kennewick, WA; San Diego, CA; and Riverside, CA. Abandon ship!",54867
2,"Decent food we went for breakfast but I was told i could order off the lunch menu. I tried the chicken sandwich with sliced apples the sandwich was good bread was fresh. The service was good we sat outside. Lots of reviews for this place I guess worth trying out for breakfast/lunch. Nothing out of this world I have to say but goof to grab a quick salad, or sandwich and sit outside to people watch. Also ordered escargot was ok nothing special came out with no bread. had to wait 7 minutes the guy said they were baking the baguettes. The bread was actually excellent !",168050

2,"If you go in for theme restaurants,this one is tops. A neat place to take people--if you can,ask to sit inside one of the boats!  Kids love this place.But be forewarned-if you are having a nice lunch or dinner in one of the 'boats',you may get some uninvited company in the form of rambunctious children who don't belong to you wanting to play on it(We did!!) -but that's more about the parents of said children.\nThis is definitely a fun place-nice bar,and a store attached when you are done eating or waiting to do so. Overall, I think the drinks are good,the food is fine,-it's good,just not great. The nachos are huge,as in tall. I've had better food-it's a bit more hype than substance in some ways. The wait staff seems to be very friendly.",298700
3,"Love this place. \nGreat sandwiches, fresh bread, nice staff who know their stuff. I have no complaints other than the fact that they seem to run out of baguette more often than not.

0,"ummm if you want a good burger go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood across the street.\n\nWe stayed at the Mirage and there always seemed to be a line for BLT, it was convenient so we thought we would give it a go. Well the service was crap, the waitress never came by barely spoke to us......  I got the Tex Mex burger and it was like dripping in sweet BBQ sauce, gross..... not very good at all, I had two bites..... We also tried the nacho basket, just a soggy mess of more sweet BBQ over chips..... I am from South Texas and like my shit hot! So maybe I am just spoiled by good nachos.... who knows but if you are excepting good food stay away, if you don't really care then go for it.... You'll be wasting $100 for two people..... But maybe you are rich and don't care.  I blame this restaurant for giving me the worst hangover ever.... Thanks a lot Obama!",325944

0,"My girlfriends and I were very excited to try DNA for an upscale bachelorette weekend.  After waiting 30 minutes (with no bread on our tables), they finally took our cocktail orders.  30 minutes later came the cocktails and some breadsticks.  The cocktails were delicious, but small pours .. and we not even given the opportunity more until 30 minutes later, when the waitress finally came out to take our dinner menu.  I ordered exactly what she recommended as their best - the tagliatelle and the hake.  The tagliatelle was very good, but anything would be that good drowned in a stick of butter - I'd give it a 4 out of 5 though on taste.  Then, the hake.  I can 100% tell you that this was the worst fish I have ever ever ever had.  It was completely tasteless and they paired it with really subtle vegetables like fennel.  Sooo unbelievably unimpressed.  Dessert was delicious - 5 out of 5.   After all was said and done, our two course meal + dessert took 3.5 hours!!  This restaurant serious needs to buff up its service and fix that hake.",455921
2,"This was the first time I have been able to attend the Brazilian Festival and I have been wanting to come now for a long time. So glad I came because I will not be returning next year.\n\nThe location is great, there's lots of space and parking available. They have the stage set up in the middle where they give great performances and have plenty of room where you are able to dance along with them if you want. They also have plenty of retail vendors and of course a small somewhat decent play area for the kids. \n\nThe food however, well I am very disappointed in that. Not enough food vendors, I believe there was only about 8-10 vendors. The Only vendor I recognized was Texas de Brazil, I did order their 3 meat sampler for $7, which of course was juicy and tender as I know their food is delicious. As for everything else, well, not impressed. I also ordered my Caipirinha for $6, which was ok. \n\nAll I'm saying is that for being a Brazilian Festival they should really have more food. The entertainment is good, the kid area can definitely improve. My suggestion, get your tickets through Groupon as you get a great value to attend and it won't feel like a waste of money when you too feel disappointed.",591841
3,"This was my second stay at this location and I was treated very well. \nUpon checking in, the manager taking me to my room to the massage at their spa I felt pampered beyond belief. The pools are great, the cabanas are snazzy and the restaurants served us well. I had a great rate, got tons of points and enjoyed all aspects of the resort.",360637
3,Very much enjoyed my dinner at Carpe Diem. \n\nI had a tasty scallop dish albeit a bit small portion wise and two delicious starters - the tuna and calamari. I was happy in the end that I did get appetizers or my meal might have been a bit small. The real stand out was the fresh bread- wow delicious..I literally couldn't stop reaching for another roll - even after I was full! \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive- he recommended a nice chardonnay for my dinner and was pleasantly surprised it was in the $8 range.The atmosphere was a little stark- nicer for a quiet date than a girls night. \n\nOverall id say bring your wallet- my meal with two drinks and an appetizer was about $60. I would absolutely visit again since everything was really yummy!,7464
0,"Expensive gimmick.  Missleading website.  Wide angle lens camera makes it look big but is smaller than my kitchen.  For $25 dollars to get in, it was a real disappointment.  We felt ripped off.

1,"We brought our mom to Pewter Rose for a \""Mother's Day\"" brunch - a week late.  I was excited because I had eaten brunch here before and really enjoyed it.\n\nArrived at 12:35 for our 12:30 reservation and checked in - the hostess said she would get us when our table was ready.  We had delicious bloody mary's at the bar and we were seated at about 12:50, right next to the closed off smoking area.  However, every time the door opened a draft of smoke filled air blew right into our table - I would suggest they actually remove that table and not seat anyone there.\n\nAbout 1pm the waiter came around to take our drink orders (he likely saw that two of us had drinks already) and came back at about 1:10 for our brunch orders.  These came out at 2pm!\n\nMy breakfast was fine (straight up breakfast) but not piping hot, my mother's (Italian omelet) the same, but my brother's biscuits and gravy were cold.  The waiter brought them back to heat them up, but by then they were nearly inedible.\n\nNot sure if they were just having some problems that day with service - a lot of people out sick? - but the experience was really quite bad.  As someone who thinks of brunch as a weekend staple, I may try again but for a restaurant at this level I would expect service to be considerably better.",79751
1,Food was a-OK..not bad...; We ordered take out and it was nice to have parking spaces up front for the take out orders.\nHubby ordered the sea clams and specifically asked for two sauces - the red sauce and the tartar sauce.  The host said they always put the two sauces in there.  We got home and there was only the red sauce.  I called them and I told the host that the hubby was not happy....she laughs.... This was the SECOND time!  and to have a the host laugh at the situation did not help.  \nI had the mussels in the garlic white wine sauce which was tasty and plentiful.  I also ordered the hearty house salad.\nThe low rating was due to the host laughing at us.... what was that all about???,612679
3,"This place is right across the street from my new job which I started about 2 months ago. I have ventured across the street about once a week during this time and have grown pretty fond of Arizona Sandwich Co.  This place surely beats the hell out of Subway which isn't saying that much but I rather pay the extra two bucks to eat here every time. My two favorites are the Sparky (turkey, bacon, and avocado) and the hot pastrami. I get my hot pastrami with jalapenos and not pickles because hey what can I say, I like it hot.",460714

1,I was with citizens Bank of Massachusetts for 10 years. We  relocated to Squirrel hill and I thought that the service would be just as good. Unfortunately the service got worse. Extremely long lines at the squirrel Hill branch and managers that have their hands tied and can't do anything to help fix problems. Any issues you may have you have to call the 800 number and you have long hold times. I like a bank where I can go in and talk to somebody and I can get something done. I am not a fan of citizens Bank.,77732

3,"One of the better dining experiences you'll have in Pittsburgh. The prices are high, but balanced with a pleasant dining area, lots of menu options and daily specials, and what might be the most friendly and accommodating staff I've ever encountered.\nI've no complaints about the food. I've had dishes that I'm taken back by with complex flavor and presentation and others that simply meet expectations for what a good meal should be, but nothing has ever been bad. Not everything is knock-my-socks off though, so 4 stars. You can't go wrong with the seafood here. Scallops are probably my favorite. \nFinish your meal with a toasted almond cake and a spanish coffee (beware the massive amount of brandy snuck into this) and be fortunate enough for the owner to consider you worthy of a complimentary43 aperitif and you've just had a very good start to your classy night out!",522495

I ordered about 40 bucks worth of various dishes... shrimp pad thai, green curry chicken, spring rolls, a thai iced tea and I think that was it.  I don't remember all that well because most of the food went into the trash.  The iced tea was about the only thing that was exceptional.  Everything else was pretty much blah.  Not a lot of meat, and the curry was super greasy.  The pad thai was dry and tasted like it was anything but fresh.  My quest for GREAT thai food continues.  The one thing that surprised me is that when I went to pick up my order, their dining room was packed with lunch guests.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes (???)",227668
