2,Pool service is terrible. Took 30 plus minutes for drink orders. We also went to Centro Lounge for dinner and service was ALSO slow! Good lord,360672
5,Yelp is the way to go! Took a shot in the dark on this place and it is amazing! Carne esada tacos and chips and salsa were great!,115631
5,two words: CASEY COMBS!!!  He HOOKED US UP!  We went for my nephew's 21st bday.  Got an awesome price for table service and an optimal spot!!!  Bottle pricing was reasonable and the music was pretty good.  The best part was the service!  He was patient as I tried to gather my party of mostly under 25 year olds and really just treated us well.  The staff was patient and friendly.  LOVE IT!!!!,180352
3,"Nice hotel, convenient to W Carson. Only complaint is the taxi service that they use. Cost $20 more than a regular cab fare to the airport and the driver was pushy about sharing his information after being told I wasn't interested. 4 star hotel gets one star taken away for who they choose as a business partner.",75630
3,ehhhh they're food is ok. the scallops were the only things I really enjoyed. everything else I feel I could do at home at a much cheaper price.,290228
3,"I was introduced to this restaurant when I use to work in the OC.  I love this chain compared to Olive Garden.  Every time I have been to a Maggiano's whether it is OC or here, I always seem to wait a little.  Just my luck probably.  We like the atmosphere and the food is good.  Below are the usual that we order:\n\nAppetizers: Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms\nPastas: Spaghetti Meatball, Fettuccine Alfredo, Lasagna\nDesserts: Creme Brulee, Tiramisu\n\nPastas are very well prepared as well, but our favorites that keep us coming back are the appetizers and desserts.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to.\n\nThe only thing that was a turn off for us for this location was that the outdoor dining we had to put up with someone that was smoking at a nearby table.  We have kids so this was rather inconvenient.",192184
3,"During the hectic after Christmastime we decided to finally try much acclaimed mexican dining establishment. Here is our assessment:\n\nVALUE  excellent\nFOOD  good\nATMOSPHERE  poor\n\nAs the meals we ordered were tasty, the restaurant was freezing (no heat) on a very cold 40 degree evening. Our food became cool and definitly ruined it's flavor. Also neither of us liked the thin tasteless hot sauce...not even as good as Taco Bell!!! Why not offer a variety of salsas.  The place was packed with hungry customers and the food and reasonable prices keep the folks coming in. Personally I think there is room for improvement.",249196
1,"Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.\n\nZoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.\n\nThe food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.\n\nThere's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again.",14442
3,"Met some friends here for a birthday party...she loves it here...I came for the company.\n\nFirst of all, parking is retarded here.  If you don't care about people parking your car, DO THE FREE VALET.  I drove my boat back there trying to find a parking space, and I couldn't find ONE space I felt comfortable leaving my car.  I ended up parking in the hotel parking lot next door and walked over after leaving the frustration known as Firefly's parking lot.\n\nI wanted the Firefly fries that I've grown to enjoy...They come with Parmesan, Herbs, and an Aioli for $6.  Since I knew I was gonna order another plate or two in addition to the fries, I decided just to spend the money for the steak and fries :P\n\n14oz Ribeye ($20): Red Wine Sauce, Cabrales Bleu Cheese, Firefly Fries and Aioli. Surprisingly large ribeye for the money! It was a good steak, cooked perfectly, but the sauce/seasoning was a little distracting. Still good though!\n\nHowever, the fries were undercooked and stupid oily.  Like \""dripping off your fingers\"" OILY.  I should have returned them, but my steak was cooked perfectly, and I thought it was a waste to turn over the plate.  They probably would have just brought me a new side of fries, but that's in hindsight. \n\nSo you can still get a decent value at Firefly...just factor in bad parking and a hint of inconsistency and you'll probably be fine!\n\nPics :",606875

5,"I love, love, love how the California casino/hotel caters to the Hawaiian community.  And Local and transplant Hawaiians reciprocate by visiting this hotel almost exclusively it seems!  Therefore, we always make it a point to visit this place when we are downtown. We stumbled upon this place at the mezzanine level of the casino and saw a long line forming out the door that just kept growing.  Of course  we had to try out the food here even though we ate not 2 hours  ago.\n\nI had the special: Ochoa zuke#1:  tea , rice, Teri chicken, spam, fishcake, Saba (mackerel) and assorted pickles... $9.99\n-nicely done and presented in bento box.  EVERYTHING was YUMMMMMMM...\n\n-ahi poke: fresh ahi tuna marinated in soy sauce, sugar, limu, green onions etc.. Generous portions and very fresh.\n\n-coffee was 50 cents and my hubby was shocked.\n\nThere really isn't an 'ambiance' here, it's basically a \""mom and pop\"" Hawaiian style cafe in a casino which for the California hotel, is quite suitable! \n\nCash only.",120345

4,"We ventured off the Vegas strip for this one. My friends kept asking me \""WHERE ARE WE GOING? IT'S SO FAR.\"" In reality - a $30 cab ride split between 4 of us was WELL worth it. \n\nDelicious food. Our waitress was very attentive. Our chef was hilarious, easygoing, fun, and obviously a great cook.\n\nDefinitely try the shrimp tempura roll... one of the best I've had. And for Hibachi I recommend the shrimp, any of the steaks, and the fried rice. I wasn't really a fan of the chicken though... a bit dry for my liking.\n\nLove, love, love this place.",532064
4,Very much enjoyed my dinner at Carpe Diem. \n\nI had a tasty scallop dish albeit a bit small portion wise and two delicious starters - the tuna and calamari. I was happy in the end that I did get appetizers or my meal might have been a bit small. The real stand out was the fresh bread- wow delicious..I literally couldn't stop reaching for another roll - even after I was full! \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive- he recommended a nice chardonnay for my dinner and was pleasantly surprised it was in the $8 range.The atmosphere was a little stark- nicer for a quiet date than a girls night. \n\nOverall id say bring your wallet- my meal with two drinks and an appetizer was about $60. I would absolutely visit again since everything was really yummy!,7464
1,"My dad bought a club card and added me to the account, I went in to get my own card and the place was 3/4 empty, people were leaving with only 1 or 2 items in their carts, I had to wait 20 min in line to get my card (which I didn't understand because there was very little business going on)  This place is completely opposite of costco.  It's amazing how different the crowds are and what people were buying.  It's apparent that people didn't like what sams club had to offer or their prices since they were buying very very little. Yet when I goto costco it's PACKED and lots of food samples and FULL carts at check out.  Several check out lanes were closed too (just like walmart) \n\nI myself didn't even buy anything at sams club that day.  \n\nI could care less if I ever go back.",139093
3,"I remember when I was younger and saw the Luxor for the first time. I wanted to stay there! When visiting Vegas recently, I decided to fork out the cash to satisfy my inner child. I don't regret staying in the Luxor - it was clean and quiet - but it wasn't what I was expecting. It's just a middle class hotel, really, and if that's what you want and the Luxor is offering a good rate, then go for it. Just make sure to learn about the resort fee before you make your reservation.\n\nAs for my experience, the Luxor was clean but the shower drain was clogged, causing an overflow onto the bathroom floor. Our room had a view of the strip, although being on the south end of the strip, the view wasn't impressive at all. The sloped window was impressive for all of two seconds. Check-in was a breeze. Finally, I'll mention that the salespeople working the hotel floor were a little annoying.",170998
4,"I'm so excited this place is here!  We just relocated to the area and are so relieved Starbucks isn't an option anymore! (Coffee price is slightly higher than starbucks)\n\nMy wife ordered a very good white chocolate mocha, which was very good, and I ordered an iced black tea.  We shared a roasted turkey, bacon, and cheese sandwich on ciabatta...it was very good.",229715
1,"Worst customer service you can come across!  Stood at the front desk for atleast 3 minutes while 2 employees finished up their personal conversation.  I was there to buy a galaxy tab so she took my name and told me it would be 15 to 20 minutes.  I kind of lost time because I was sending texts and emails while I waited.  I noticed a lot of people started to complain so I looked at the time since my first text message was sent and it had been 45 minutes!  I went to the counter and asked where I was on the list,  she told me it would be 15 to 20 minutes!  When I told her she said that 45 minutes ago she snaps back and says \""sir these are estimates only\"" which at that point I turned around and walked out.  I wasted almost an hour of my time and they could care less.  I work in an industry where we have long wait times as well so I get it but it's all about how you come off to customers which most of the time you can turn a negative experience into a positive one.  I've never been to this store before and I won't be back.  I recently switched from at&t to sprint and have been very happy with sprint's service.  Corporate should really take a long look at this horrendous store and realize they are jepordizing their brand with stores like this one! I ended up going to best buy and was in and out in 15 minutes including activating my service.  Like I said I'm happy with sprint an will continue to support them its just a shame on how bad the retail store is!",68207
3,"Not very happy with Craig right now. The station has a cash price and credit price listed, cash is .05\u00a2 cheaper. I used my FRN card which have me a .05\u00a2 discount too AND I paid with cash. However Craig said I'm only eligible for one discount... well, the folks at FRN disagree. We'll see what happens...",146394
5,First time at this club last night! Omgosh I love this club already. Calvin Harris was awesome! He's so pretty. Dance floor is kind of small but it's alright. Had a super great time. Awesome and nice people minus maybe a hand full. We're all just trying to have a good time.  Great ending to a bachlorette party weekend.,597237

1,"This is by far the worst restaurant experience that I have ever encountered so far. I've driven by Sevens' plenty of times before they opened, looked them up online and was excited to try them out. Their menu looked really good and tasty. I finally got around to having dinner there this past weekend. The menu you see on their website for lunch & dinner is not what you'll see when you go in. Online, they combine both their lunch and dinner menus making it appear larger. But when we were there on a Friday night around 7, we were only given the dinner menu which was about half the size. Now that I'm looking at their menu online, the prices are also not accurate. It's probably because they're showing the lunch prices which are typically lower.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was dead. There were a few people at the bar and two other tables. We were seated inside the restaurant close to the patio. They had the patio doors open making it way too cold. Some heat lamps were definitely needed. Good thing I wore a leather jacket. The restaurant is really well decorated, clean, and modern. I didn't see what it used to look like as Avalon so I don't know how much they remodeled. We were greeted and seated right away.\n\nWe got the monkey bread and spinach and artichoke dip to start for 5 of us. The monkey bread was raw. At first we thought it was gooey cheese, no it was raw dough. Bleh! We told the waiter and he took it away and later brought us out a new one. The new one was clearly burnt. I didn't even bother trying it. The small piece of the first one I had was okay. Tasted similar to Red Lobster's cheesey biscuits with some honey. I thought it was supposed to have garlic butter? The spinach and artichoke dip came out on a huge plate. However, there were probably 8 wedges of pita to go with it. The dip was edible but way too garlicy. There needs to be more pita for the proportion of dip though. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the duck sliders to split and the lemon basil chicken. Other people got burgers, duck sliders, and french onion soup. The duck sliders were okay. I took the onion, cilantro, jalapeno off because I don't like them. We also asked for the spicy mayo sauce to be on the side. Good thing we asked if it came with a sauce since it didnt' say on the menu. If your familiar with those pork buns you can get at he Asian Bakeries for $2, that's pretty much what it tasted like. Good but not worth $12. My boyfriend at the sandwich with the condiments on it and said that it didn't go well together at all. The chips are those kinds you get at the fair. However, just looking at them, you can tell that they were drenched in the cooking oil. They were so soggy and flimsy. How did the cook see that and think it looked appetizing? Another person got the duck sliders which came out 15 minutes later for some reason and the chips were just as soggy. Our meals didn't really come out at the same time but I guess I'd rather get it right away than have it sitting under a heat lamp. The fries that come with the burger are similar to those from Steak and Shake (thin-cut/shoe string fries). Those were probably the best thing out of the whole meal. I was told that the burgers were good. Our lemon chicken was horrible. I've never had to return something back to the kitchen before but it just wasn't good and not worth $20. It was really sour (not sweet and sour, just sour) and the chicken was really rubbery. The chicken was in little strips, I was expecting an actual piece of chicken breast that you usually get at restaurants.\n\nOur drinks sometimes went empty but other than that our waiter was really nice and accommodating. He didn't question that the monkey bread was raw or that we didn't like our dish. \n\nI don't think any of us will ever go back. There are just too many other options in Old Town that are so much better. What a shame.\n\nGot a message from Jake J. probably someone who has a share in the restaurant since he posted those professional photos. An average diner wouldn't have access to those. Here's what he's got to say: \""Got love the complainers. They always have yelp accounts. I had to write once I saw your review. Monkey bread is my favorite and it is not raw in the middle it is melted cheese. Figured you would know that with your advanced pallet or see it with your own eyes. Can't please everyone. Ive been there so many times never had one complaint nor heard one around me until this stupid site that have so called \""wanna be food critics\"" didn't momma teach u anything..... If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. Guess not. Typical \""yelper\""\"" Funny because he has written unfavorable reviews in the past, some even promoting Sevens'. Some people are silly.",565029
2,No longer carrying 5 dollar subs so off to Subway - I think the Subway offers and taste blow Quiznos away. When they offered the $5.00 subs I ate there out of convenience since it is so close to me.

5,"Great Harvest's bread and customer service @ Rea Road is over-the-top!  The staff who work there are always friendly and go the extra mile for the customer.  I stopped by to pick up two gluten free bread loaves they had on hold for me; my wife is gluten intolerant, but not allergic.  While talking with the to person behind the desk (later found out to be one of the owners), they encouraged me to try a loaf of their spelt bread. She explained that it is similar to wheat but has a different protein, and often people who think they are intolerant to gluten, can often eat Great Harvest's spelt loafs because they are made with great, wholesome ingredients.  Wow did the spelt bread taste good!  My wife had no reaction to it either.  Our next step is to try some of their wheat loafs.  We are so excited that my wife may have the option of eating real bread again!  Thank you Great Harvest Bread Company @ Rea Road.",419322
5,We have been taking our pets here for over 15 years.  Bunnies....kitties...all get treated with love and respect.   Fantastic new building...super comfortable for you and your lil ones.  \n\nCan't recommend them high enough!\n\nJon,23109
2,This place is simply confusing! And not in a good way. It's a nice place but it does not define itself at all. The menu includes breakfasr items but no lunch items and it does not have typical bar food either. No chicken wings yet there are tvs all over the place setting up the place to be a typical bar. It tries to be a wine bar but the wine list is very limited. We ordered the ordinary nachos which were decent and I also had the grilled  chicken sandwich which I ended up just eating the  chicken breast.  we went on a weekday so it might be different on the weekend but if u want a wine bar or a regular bar or a place to have a nice meal there are better options. the owners need to figure out what their concept is because it just left us confused and frustrated.,447201
4,"After much research into finding a good buffet in Vegas, I found the Wicked Spoon. I had read some horror stories about other buffets, so I was pretty picky about where we ate on our first trip to Vegas. This buffet did not disappoint.\n\nFirst of all, it is expensive. $80 for two people, but that did include all you can eat and soft drinks. The buffet was the most high end I have ever been to. It had appetizers which included a variety of salads, a meat and cheese spread, shrimp cocktail and more. The main course dishes went on forever. Crab legs, bone marrow, lobster claws, mac and cheese bar, fried chicken, sweet potato mash, Korean short ribs, pizza, I could go on and on and on. My absolute favorite thing by far was the gnocchi. It was quite possibly the best gnocchi I have ever had, the sauce was fantastic, the gnocchi was perfect, soft and cooked to perfection. I would go back and only have that every single time. The dessert section also seemed to have an extraordinary amount of variety. Puddings, gelato, cake, pie, cheesecake, cookies, rice pudding, and my favorite, enormous chocolate covered strawberries dipped in Heath bar or Reese cups. Again, if all they served was gnocchi and those strawberries, I would pay for it time and time again.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, our server was great, she kept our table clear and our drinks full. It wasn't super busy when we were there, but I can imagine it would get a little crazy if it would be busier. I recommend an early dinner or late lunch because when we finished by 6:30p or so, people were pouring in. It's a place you must try, but you won't ever look at another buffet the same way!",492297
4,"Saw all the great reviews on Yelp and had to try this place. We were very happy we did! So close to home and love the neighborhood pizzeria feel. Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage and garlic, 3 cheese Stromboli and garlic knots....OMG the garlic knots!!! They were fluffy pillows of buttery, garlicky goodness that not only smelled good but made our mouths water as their wonderful aroma filled the air around us. The pizza was BETTER than the NYC pizza I had in NYC and made me feel good knowing I don't have to travel 3000 miles to get amazing pizza. The crust was thin, crisp and chewy, sauce was perfect, cheese is good quality and toppings very generous. We will definitely be back and spread the word. Thanks to Yelp we saved 50% off our pizza order just for checking in today between 2-5pm.",553177

5,"This is 1 of 2 of my favorite breakfast spots in Charlotte. I like it because while they have the usuals of eggs and waffles (both with a twist you won't find in diners), the French inspired menu gives Cafe Monte a uniqueness I haven't found elsewhere in town. Crepes, quiche, great espresso, even steak & frites are all good bets.",342469
2,"First things first, let's talk about the ONLY reason to (in my not so humble opinion) visit this restaurant...  Fried Chicken!  It's good.  No, It's really, really good.  If you need something tasty along with it, try the zucchini fries.  They're good, too and the dipping sauce is perfect.   \n\nAnd there ends my praise for the Fox.  Sadly, everything else I have tried on the menu has been bland, or just fallen short of my expectations.\n\nI've tried the catfish, the fried steak, the BLT, and several other things.  Everything tastes like they're out of seasoning.  After my last visit, I won't be back.  There's just too many other great options.  I would meet friends there if asked, and if so, I'd get the chicken.\n\nThe place is also pretty loud and the tables are crowded.  Service has never been an issue, the wait-staff is very nice.",542065
3,"This review is for the Mojito Bar located in front of the Seafood Shack and we were staying at Treasure Island Hotel and got a 2 for 1 drink at the Mojito Bar as part of our package.  The drinks were good, we ordered a Mermaid mojito and Cherry Breeze and the breeze was a bit on the sweet side.",573139
4,Aiello's vs Mineos. Aiello's is not bad. Don't think it's as good as people make it out to be.  Had 2 pepperoni slices. Didn't re-heat all that well. The staff is super super friendly. Very welcoming place. Very much a great neighborhood spot. If I lived close to hear I would be back more often.,77521
5,"Food that creates a smile is great food, but food that inspires--that's fantastic food.  The slider truck, although casually camouflaged with a comic theme and serving nothing but sliders, creates great eats that are inspiring for those who love to eat and for those who want to cook.  With the food comes the people, a plethora of individuals that somehow meld together into a friendly mass of hungry fans.  Despite the wait time for excellent sliders the people converse as if they know each other, making the wait seem like a few minutes rather than a bit longer.  I don't mind waiting in line with the cult followers because they are a mixture of artists, parents, students, geeks, photographers, and more.  While waiting in line for the slider truck you get an intelligent conversation in with great people. I love it.\n\nWith the crowd comes the need to feed, and the slider truck delivers wonderful morsels of juicy burger love.  They changed me, turning me into a fan of things I do not normally eat, and that is a feat in itself.  The menu is simple and there are days when they have secret menu items available as well, items that their regulars will wait an hour in line for just to get a taste.  Today it was the french dipper, a roast beef slider with melted cheese, onions and mushroom with a side of au jus.  I tried one and it was to die for--tender, juicy, packed from top to bottom bun and seasoned so well that I wish I ordered four more.  I will definitely dream of that french dipper till the next time it's on the secret menu.  When it comes to turning me, the pulled pork sandwich--one that I refuse to eat ever--became an instant favorite of mine from the slider truck.  It's perfectly cooked and the barbecue sauce is spicy, sweet, and oh so smooth.  That pulled pork is juicy and tender, well seasoned and the sandwich, although slider size, is packed full of it.  The other thing that I hate to eat are jalapenos, but they make a jalapeno jelly that I cannot get enough of on their Captain slider.  I could eat fifty of those burgers with the jalapeno jelly on it.  \n\nWith the mind changing food comes great service.  The owner handles the truck personally, along with three to four of his trusted friends that basically line cook to keep the food coming out fast.  They are all friendly, always smiling and they take extra care to pack everything nicely and with everything you need.  A great touch is the candy that you get with every order, because candy can make anyone smile even on a bad day.\n\nThese sliders are like no other.  They are amazingly filling, great tasting, with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The texture of the patties are perfect, and their sweet rolls that they split into a bun are yummy.  I love the slider truck with all my heart, and they inspired me to try something different every once in awhile.  if you think that this food truck is like others, serving plain food fast and greasy, you have it all wrong.  They serve unique, what I consider gourmet style sliders on the fly. With great prices and service, and the fun crowd and fun times trying to find the truck daily, this is a stop that I'm willing to drive across town to line up for any day of the week.\n\nLine up soon and get your slider fix today, before the food runs out.  The crowds are a plenty, but the specials may not last till you're ready to show up.  That's the fun in this truck--finding it, lining up, talking to people, and then finally eating your addiction.  Get it hot and fast with a smile.  What more could you ask for?  As for myself, nothing.  They are everything that I need when I want my burger fix.\n\nThanks for the inspiration, slider truck.",448147

Driving through a dramatic desert mountain the last thing you might expect is a great little place with true Hawaii shaved ice with real Dole pineapple and soft serve ice cream.

Me and a few of my girlfriends hit up babystacks to devour some pancakes after yelping breakfast spots to eat. We ordered the stack of red velvet pancakes, banana cream pancakes, strawberry pancakes, two orders of garlic fried rice, AND an order of their seasoned fries. A weird mix of salty and sweet but whatever! The rice was on point, down to the last grain. The seasoned fries were crispy to perfection and the pancakes were fluffy and tasty!! The fruits were all fresh, their homemade whip cream was thick and creamy, and the toppings were so delicious and sweet. You know their food is bomb when you cant recommend one pancake over the other. All were so goooood!",480706

4,"I should just stop calling these reviews part of my cider tour of the Phoenix area and seek sponsorship from Strongbow instead because it's the only draught they, being bars with an Irish theme, have other than the one blowing up my arse about these being Irish pubs that is.\n\nDon't worry by my second pint this review gets friendlier. \n\nLet's start with the appetizers and the curious price of curry and chips. $8.95.The price of the curry sauce and the chips ($2.50 and $4.00 when ordered separately)  is an application of new math that I find puzzling. *\n\nOk the first pint is warming me up and it's time to praise the banger wontons Nope it's not an Asian street gang but a dab of pork sausage and herbs within a wonton wrapper.  These are really good, pretty inventive and the spicy sauce that comes with them ( seems to be HP , Vinegar and something I can't quite put my  tongue on ( horseradish?)  , while good, is a little  overpowering for the center.  We really liked these.\n\nPint 2:\n\nMy wife had the beer battered fish and chips and loved them but she'll get to that in her review. I had the shepherd's pie boxty , basically ground lamb/ beef  wrapped up in a potato based crepe/ pancake.  The filling was light, moist and nicely spiced  unlike the usual attempts by most places to hide up a culinary crime scene. E.g If you can't do the thyme...  The accompanying veggies, asparagus and peppers were a nice touch and you can see the visual appeal of the dish on the accompanying picture. \n\nDesert. \n\nWe had. ok we ordered,  the Irish whiskey creme brulee , most of the desserts here are about as Irish as George Takei, and it was absent of any whiskey taste that either of us could discern.It's OK but a let down given the promise.    Knocking off .5 stars for that and the appetizer pricing. \n\nFood came out really quickly  in under 10 mins. It  was about 1430 when we came in and the place was kinda quiet. Mallory provided great service throughout.\n\n*I wrote their corp office and Eric returned an explanation within an hour. the disparity in the chip/curry conundrum lies with the curry sauce. The \""side\"" of sauce is supposed to be 3oz less than the appetizer.",376692
3,"Another \""do-it-yourself\"" bridal shop with rows of dresses tightly packed on racks in big plastic bags.   The woman was super quick swapping out the dresses in the room.  As soon as I walked out in a new dress, she had the old one out and the new one ready to go and waiting for me in my room.  I might have rated this store a bit higher, but I didn't seem to have any luck here.  Dresses were either way too big or way too small and I just didn't find any that I liked.  I have heard of many people having success here and the prices are reasonable, just didn't work for me.  The dress shopping continues. . .",50838

1,"It was my first time boarding my dogs of 6yrs. I was very nervous and saw that they have great reviews but I was unsure. The staff seemed very pleasant.  I came to drop my dogs off and asked to see where they would be kept. I was met with a  bit of hesitation despite it being an option.. They took me back through the \""Bahamas' room which they said to put them in, I was very uncomfortable walking through, dogs looked dirty and were going crazy. It had the feel and appeal of a humane society. They thankfully took me through to a quieter room \""Maui\"" and put them in a kennel run, that was indoor/outdoor. I left them their dog pillow and uncomfortably left.\n  \nWhen I returned to pick them up, the lady called in back and requested them picked up from Bahama's! I hope not!  When my dogs came out they were dirty and smelled horrible. The dog pillow was filthy and stunk I almost wanted to throw it in the dumpster (I wish I had during the car ride ). When I put them in the car,  my boyfriend and I gagged automatically. We had to pull over because the smell was so bad I thought I was going to puke.  :(  I washed the dogs and the pillow cover asap, but it took some scrubbing to get the grime off. \n\nI do not know what went on but I am horrified by this.  I look back on the reviews and they are mostly about the Veterinary side. My  mistake!\nI WILL NEVER TAKE THEM HERE, and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!",306553

1,"Nothing Joyful about it. Worst I've had in years. The restaurant is in a failing strip mall. No windows, dark and dingy and it smelled of Pine sol.  Staff did not greet us with a smile ( I can't blame them, maybe too depressed). We went at lunchtime and the place was empty - save for one table.  I ordered the Kung Pao as a safe bet. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the sauce was salty - tasted mostly like soy sauce. I thought maybe it was just me, so I took the rest home for my husband. He said it was \""inedible\"". Then I told him where I went and he said \""I could have told you that, that place is awful\"". \nMy friend ordered the Shrimp in Lobster sauce, she said it was ok, but she would never go back. The egg rolls were soggy and greasy and the fried rice was non nondescript. I have no idea why anyone would give this place 5 stars! I know it's been around a while - maybe they are regulars.",45920
5,"This is a perfectly awesome sports bar.\n\nYou can go there for any big game for any sport, and they will have it on one of their many screens WITH SOUND!!  They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.\n\nI recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.  \n\nMy only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.\n\nIf your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. \n\nBefore I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \""5-star\"" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.\n\nAt its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.  Good food, done right.",9641

3,"Is the food good? Yes. Is the service? Fast for large groups but these people are RUDE. I've heard of them making fun of fat people. They also cracked jokes about my friend and I when we were there. When I was outside parking my bike, the owner GLARED at me while I locked it. Unprofessional and crude service here. I can take my service elsewhere, thank you.",270687

2,Stumbled across this restaurant with a friend visiting in and decided to take a chance with it and do I regret making that choice.\n\nWhen we went in it looked busy and took a while for them to stay us but then we were led into the other dining area which was nearly empty (only about three or for people exited from here when we entered). \n\nI ordered the chicken pad Thai and all three of us got a mango smoothie. When the food came my chicken in the pad Thai was tough and dry although the noodles were okay. When or drinks came they gave my friend a cup that was filled 75% compared to mine. When my friend complained they said it was because it was all that was left in the blender after pouring the previous two. Could they not have bothered to put in the effort to make a bit more so it didn't look as bad? It really wasn't that busy.... Service was bad to begin with as well and slow. \n\nNerve coming here again.\n\nOverall two stars both for service and quality of food.,518429
5,"great place for dinner and I love being able to sit on the patio as the day winds down.  As good as their food and service is, I wanted to extend kudos to them for a problem I had.  My credit card showed up with an erroneous charge, and when I called, they investigated and made sure they handled it to my satisfaction.  Nice to have a place that has good food & wine, and is very customer-oriented in every detail !",573011
2,"It's a little place I think over in terminal A next to the only brewery bar in the airport. The service was good but I didn't like my sweet Italian sausage. It came in a warm bun with peppers and onion. There are so many other places in the airport that are better for the price. This sweet sausage cost with tax, $6.50ish.",284938
1,"DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!!! I would give them a zero if I could. I actually paid for the service and it is a complete scam. They promise you that if you pay for the listing you can contact the owners directly. They don't mention that it's by mail only!! In addition, they have a prewritten letter they have for you to send to the owner is to request for a rent to own. I don't even want to own a home. The listing on Trulia was for rent. I thought that they were legitimate because I have paid for a similar service before from a different company however I actually received direct contact information. Also I assumed that since it was on Trulia then it was ok (that was my fault for assuming). I have also seen them on Zillow so be careful. I wish I would have read Yelp first. I hope this helps someone before they make the same mistake I did.",599667
3,"I love thai rama for the most part their panang curry and evil jungle noodles are always on point.  But service at this location was not on point, yeah the girl was nice but majority of the time she was on the phone with god knows who.  She rarely came over to see how our food was or if we wanted more to drink given the fact that our food's spice level was a lot hotter than what we asked for.  My friend ordered the paht thai( for some reason is always dry regardless of location)  and myself the panang curry as usual.  My friend had asked for no spices in hers and it came out hotter than my medium panang.  The girl apparently misunderstood our orders obviously since she had nothing to write down our orders on. She said after getting off the phone that it was her mistake even though apparently the chefs have been off  as far as getting the spice levels on point.  \n\nShe came back after a few minutes and said \""the cook that made your dish was...MEXICAN\"" my friend and I could not believe this white girl said that (we are half filipino) to us like that would make a difference. The way she said it was just bizzare to us. If I were part mexican I would have been pissed. It shouldn't matter what someone's race is on who is making the food.  The service was poor here our food came out spicier than called for and the egg rolls seemed lightweight stale.  Not a great way to start our day.",372817
4,"Came in a few times before and ordered drinks with dinner.  The trick to liking this place is to order drinks at the counter.  That was you get to see the giant hunk of ginger, see the bar tenders squeezing limes, watch them actuallly muddle drinks with care.  The drinks are good, but the show, even better.",305446
2,"This place was mediocre at best. I went with my sister for lunch. The rolls were completely overpriced ($11 and $13), which wouldn't have bothered me so much if they were good. Bland doesn't even describe them. We got the Sakura and Geisha roll and for all the delicious goodness that was supposed to be in them, I was extremely disappointed at how crappy they were. I was totally in the mood for sushi too, which makes it suck even more! They were a nice size, which is why I gave this place the 2 stars. At least I wasn't starving, I was just lacking good sushi when I walked out. And the service there is almost as bland as the food is. And I agree with someone who said it in another review...those seats are HORRIBLE!! Maybe it's a better nighttime spot? Who knows, I won't be going back.",381360
3,"On the corner of a dirty little strip mall, this little place blends in with the other various ethnic storefronts, but don't let that scare you- the food is worth the trip. \n\nThe decor of the place is not bad- nice tables and chairs with a little vase of fake flowers- no corny painting on the wall, and no pretense of trying to be someplace they aren't. It's a simple place, with simple food. \n\nI had the falafel, and my companion had the lamb. All entrees come with salad- which is really a plate of cut up veggies (cucumber, pickles, jalapeno, onion), cilantro, and yogurt sauce, pita bread, and soup. The soup tasted like lamb broth. Not my favorite. It wasn't bad with rice and cilantro added to it, but it wasn't that great either.\n\nThe falafel was really good- a little crunchier than I am used to, but the flavor was fantastic. The lamb was good too- i'm not a big fan of lamb, but this was really tasty. \n\nTraditional hot tea can be had for a mere fifty cents, but I advise you ask them not to sweeten it if you're a purist. They put quite a bit of sugar in it. \n\nAll in all, a good trip. Our bill topped out at an amazingly cheap $16 and change, and we had leftovers. Well worth it.",371347
2,"First of all, like everyone else, I've wanted to try this place. I've heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. \n\nI arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), \""We don't seat parties if they aren't all here, but you can check if they're in there.\"" Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. \n\nFirst of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer's platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there's a difference between good and thinking something's good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. \n\nSecond, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I've had better service when Binion's Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. \n\nThird, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you're practically sitting on their neighbor's lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don't get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. \n\nFourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she \""LOST\"" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would've picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I'm not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn't be that rude to anyone! \n\nI give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it's worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We'll see...\n\nSo Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to  pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn't  running around forgetting people's orders, losing people's credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer's platters can pay a waiter's 4 hour shift and they'd provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!",427128

How many restaurants can be romantic and clubby at the same time?  Nove fits in well with The Palms.   \n\nThe food is fantastic.  I would recommend the starter of tomato soup and grilled cheese.  It's an interesting take on a classic item.  The portions are large so keep that in mind as you order.\n\nI had my birthday dinner here, and the host was so nice, and sent over a shot of champagne.

After 15, we had to give up and leave or we would have been late to work.

4,"I was just visiting Pittsburgh and I never been to the city before so I came here because everyone said that Primanti Brothers is a rite of passage.  So I went.\n\nHISTORY:  The original one is located in the Pittsburgh Strip District, a really busy area along with the Allegheny River which are dotted with warehouses and produce yards.  The owner, Joe Primanti, invented his famous sandwich during the Great Depression.  This spawned all kinds of sandwiches and the restaurant became a stop for late-night and early-morning workers.  For decades, it was a big food stop for truck drivers. Because they usually had to get their burgers or sandwiches to go, the restaurant started putting the fries inside the burgers and sandwiches so they can eat their entire meal with ease while driving. That eventually became their signature piece for all their sandwiches. Even though it's an eatery for all and is a foodery stop for everyone crazy about the Burgh, the original Primantis still keeps it's super large parking lot for truck drivers to make their routine stop for food. Pittsburgh is a working class city who loves (LOVES) their sports so Primanti Brothers is an insanely popular place to pre or post-game or to game-game while eating and drinking. It's now a chain that is all throughout the east coast but in Pittsburgh it's a staple.  Whenever TV stations (notably ESPN) do an expose on the city, Primanti Brothers is always mentioned, visited and spotlighted.\n\nFOOD: Heavy. They put their fries inside their burger. Um, I guess that's a novelty but conceptually it's like a turducken. Kind of too much.  But excess is the theme of all their signature burgers and sandwiches or you can custom-make your excess.  Add more fries, sauces, an egg, double up on meat, combine different kinds of meat.  Mention the word diet and everyone will look at you as if you're from California, which in this case, is true. But the restaurant, per their menu, states that their sandwiches are only the number 2 favorite.  The title of number one favorite goes to beer.  Not a particular kind.  Just beer in general.  Smile.\n\nSERVICE: Incredibly friendly and they love the question \""What's your favorite?\"" to which the answer will, again, be beer.  Another smile.  Tell them you're new and just visiting Pittsburgh, they'll relish the opportunity to fill you in on not just the favorites of the menu but their personal favorites in the city at large.\n\nCONSENSUS:  Definitely not a place to eat if you're dieting, paleo or vegan unless it's a cheat day or you relapse into the world of meat.  But if you can appreciate the hearty sports bar fanfare, you'll find yourself at home here with your stomachs full.  The restaurant, itself, is very welcoming and the bar area is incredibly social, especially if there is a game playing.  As a visiter of the city as a whole, I don't know if this is characteristic to the restaurant or the city as a whole, but, regardless, I will swing by again when I have business in Pittsburg in the future.  I'll just make sure that it is also a cheat day.",471072
2,"Before I jump into my review I want to say that this place isn't necessarily \""Meh\"" for everyone. I've had many a massage for varying prices and quality, so based on that is why this place gets 2-stars.  I picked this place to go based on the reviews, but I guess I have a more picky palette when it comes to people touching me.\n\nCOST - Yes, this place is probably the cheapest and more decent for the price for a regular massage. But, I've had massages for about the same price in Hawaii that was better (And Hawaii is expensive as hell, like Las Vegas). I paid $89 for a 90 minutes massage.  It's a decent price I think, but just comparatively, I've had better for close to the same cost, if not cheaper.\n\nMASSAGE EXPERIENCE - Maybe I'm jaded or have been getting massages wrong for the past couple years, but usually when I get I massage they start with my back since usually there is the most tension there is probably requires the most attention, but what do I know? I'm not a massage therapist, but what I can say is that everything else was done first and my back last.  That's not something I'm use to and whether or not that is normal is for a pro to determine, but what I can say is that I feel like my back needed a lot more attention.  Also my neck needed a lot more attention, as I type this my neck hurts. That was one of the first things worked on, which I usually like ending with that.  I could mention many other things about my massage experience that had me unimpressed, but the order of things was a major one.\n\nAMBIANCE - The room itself was great. No complaints here.  Probably one of the better rooms I've had a massage in. As for the building, it was in the midst of renovations, which I can't complain about, but it just made the place look shady.\n\nPAYMENTS???? - Okay, so I made my appointment online, which I think is weird because if I don't know anything about massages, how am I to know what \""type\"" is best for my ailments?  Not only that, but they missed an opportunity to get me to spend more money, but because I did not understand their ordering system I just bought whatever massage I was familiar with.  I would've totally done more, but there was no customer service to sell me on more.  Not only was I peeved about that, but I had to pay for my appointment before I even got massaged.  That is ODD. Who does that? But I paid for it anyway.  I was peeved again that I could not add a tip to my payment, so I had to go withdraw cash before I came in and I did not know the neighborhood.\n\nOVERALL - Meh, seriously, but I'm basing this off the fact that I've been to many a massage therapist.  I'm a bit of a snob and usually when I find someone good I stay with that person, but I have yet to find someone in Las Vegas for me. :(",72485
4,"I went here for restaurant week w my fianc\u00e9, and was impressed. It was super yummy! I really liked the green chili pork. We were sat at the tables by the kitchen and it was fun to watch the dynamic of the staff. I would have liked to see more of the decor of the actual restaurant though. The bread basket was one of the best I've ever seen at a restaurant. Good assortment. The cornbread was my fav! Was full after my appetizer, very hearty portions! I was thinking- how am I going to do a 3 course meal?! Great time at roaring fork! :)",103367
2,"Was recommended by the concierge at our hotel. Went on a Fri. nite around 6:45pm. Drove up and parking lot was dead, not a good sign. After being seated the waiter came around, it was hard to hear him over the music. When the food came it was, for the most part, disappointing. The tempura was light and not at all greasy. Sauces were pretty good but it stopped there. Those who had the sushi weren't blown away. Expectations were high as the waiter informed us that Roka Amor was voted best sushi restaurant in the country?! One person ordered the waygu beef and it was way too fatty. The pork belly appetizer, again way too fatty. The chicken teriyaki, I have had better. On the whole, the atmosphere and food were underwhelming. I'm confused by the rave reviews. May have been an off night for the restaurant but won't know as don't plan on going back. Expensive.",295400
2,"We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say, the best part was the complimentary valet parking!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm, thinking the restaurant would be packed, only to find it about a quarter full.  Did we go to the right place?  From what I had heard, I expected there to be a line out the door like there was both times we went to Chima for past Restaurant Weeks.  It's a nice looking place, very open yet cozy, and it has a great bar area.  The server, John, was great and took good care of us, so no complaints there.  It was the food that was lackluster, and for the money, I wish we had gone elsewhere.  The bread was fresh and a good start (2 kinds, and a spread with olives as well as an oil and balsamic vinaigrette to wet it down). The Fattouch salads were good, though I question the use of iceberg lettuce for presentation as it looked like a low end salad with some red peppers, olives and a nasty tomato thrown in.  My partner had a Flat Iron Steak which he ordered medium well and got medium rare.  The first few bites were good, but it toughened as it cooled, and he had some difficulty cutting it as well as the asian broccoli (which he gave up on).  Being a vegan, I wasn't sure I would find anything to eat, but i did see a Mushroom Bolognese pasta dish that I ended up ordering.  It had a great taste, but the homemade pasta was a bit al dente and stuck together.  More like the wide rice noodles in some asian dishes.  Still, I enjoyed mine.  No vegan desert option for me (fresh fruit option, please?), but my partner ordered the chocolate cake and said it was good but very rich.  It all seemed to disappear, though, so that says something!  Overall, a decent dining experience, if we were spending maybe $40-50 max, tip included.  $30 each plus 2 iced teas ($6.98) and tip came to just under $90.  At least I felt like I got my one's worth with the valet at $5 for a tip, it saved me $1 off parking myself and then walking a block!  Still, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  With all the great dining our city has, I think there are better choices for the money...Ilios Noche comes to mind for great atmosphere, service and menu selection at about $20-25 less, and then we could still catch a movie!",7016
4,"I have been coming here since 2006. Before it was named Mint Bistro, it was called Himilayan & Napalese Cuisine. They used to not have a lunch buffet. The lunch buffet is great. I go to UNLV and I used to come here often for lunch. The owners are really nice. They food is really flavorful. They try to change the entrees up as often as possible. There is always chicken tandoori, and Kheer, which is all that I need to make me happy. Sometimes they have Saag, and it's so delicious. The music is nice and the ambiance is very pleasant. They have vegan and vegetarian dishes and an assortment of appetizers that go really well with mint chutney. They also have fresh fruit and salad. It is well worth the ~$9.00.",143918
1,Went there for memorial day weekend the racist bastard at the door did want to let me in because of my foreign Belizean ID from the Belizean Embassy in Los Angeles. He was very rude to me and my party yelled at us and told us to leave the building or he would call the cops. It was a very stressful ordeal now Rehab dont want to refund us our money.I left emails and called and still no response. They need to learn to respect customers. Iam 28 years old and was being treated like a minor trying to use a fake ID.... I will never give up..,231439

The staff was friendly and accommodating despite the fact that we had made our appointments just that morning.\n\nAbout my wax:\nI had a Brazilian wax and my \""waxpert\"" was Carla. I had been having trouble with ingrown hairs so she spent the first few minutes explaining about the different types of wax (they offer hard and soft w/strips) and learning about my hair and skin. Throughout the wax she talked me through and was very nice, like talking to a friend. They are very hygienic here, no double dipping! After the wax Carla went to great lengths to tweeze the ingrown hairs as well as recommend products (they have their own line).

1,"Awful restaurant! This place USED TO BE AWESOME when it was Lolita's. The new-age Mexican food they offered was flavorful and every dish was a culinary experience. Since this place became Coconuts the food has turned to crap. Everything we tried was overcooked, under seasoned and swimming in tasteless sauce.  Tables were sticky and dirty, not tablecloths, and poor service given.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and do not come to eat here. It's a waste of time and money.",531122
3,"It's not a mega resort but it's a good deal for the money.  I was here for a week long \""convention\"" of sorts.  It was really a crazy and wild party that has taken me so long to recover from that I'm behind on my reviews :o)\n\nThe rooms are a good size but there is nothing interesting about them.  The showers were OK but mine had a terrible drip that kept me up the first night and I had to have it fixed the following day.  The maid service was good and consistent.  They have a lot of problems with their room keys becoming demagnetized and I heard several people complaining about this.  It happened to me when I was coming back at 6:00am in the morning with blisters on my feet...so I wasn't happy about walking all the way back the front desk for a new key.\n\nThe pool area is nice but slippery.  I fell once and it was very embarrassing but then I saw several other people slip and fall too.  Yikes that seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen.\n\nThey have three restaurants on the premises and they are pretty good.  The casino is not that big but it has everything you could want.  I didn't win anything but then that's nothing new.\n\nI'm sure that my convention will be here again next year and I'm looking forward to going back...",137985
2,Overcharged and overfilled.\nThey insisted that my car required synthetic oil which I found out after was not the case.  They overfilled my car with oil resulting in my car leaking oil in the garage for many days in a row.  I am going to the dealer next time.,147860
1,"Avoid Downtown, but especially AVOID BOYD'S!!! I had my purse snatched INSIDE THE CASINO! Security told me not to call police, that they'd handle everything. They took down my address and other information - and put me on their advertising mail list! \n\nAgain: I got ROBBED there, and instead of calling the police, they put me on their spam list. I even get postcards to remind me that I was robbed and got zero justice!\n\nI went to the police the next day and was told that this was the usual runaround they give people who are robbed in their casinos, so that they don't look bad. I literally called every day for two months trying to get something done.  Nada. \n\nWhatever you do, DO NOT GO TO BOYD'S!!! YOU ARE NOT SAFE THERE!!!!",121164
4,"I like coming down here on a Tuesday or Thursday night for a drink, late meal and karaoke. The food here is actually quite good - I've had their build it yourself burger (which was yummy and filling) and the chicken strips. Gotta say the chicken strips were less than impressive, but I did like the burger. The beer is good too, and they have good drink specials during karaoke. Thursday is ladies' night too, so having a vagina definitely helps there.\n\nSpeaking of karaoke - I love coming down here for Karate Karaoke. Ali Raccoon runs it on Tuesday and Big Sexy takes care of the ladies on Thursday, plus it's usually a pretty short queue.\n\nAll in all, if you want to relax and sing a bit come on down and check it out.",476071
5,"I stopped in with a party of 6 last week and had a great experience.  It was a Tuesday night so we were seated right away.  Our server Chelsea took great care of us giving great recommendations from beer, to appetizers, to entrees.  I had the 3 meat plate with the baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork with sides of pecan coleslaw and roasted veggies. I had to stop myself from finishing it because my taste buds were taking priority over my hunger.  I was happy I did because I had a great lunch to take to work the next day.  The warm cinnamon mini donuts were a welcome addition on the way out as always!",203491
3,"My favorite thing about this hot spot? The gelato bar! What buffet do you know that has all you can eat gelato with a good variety of flavors? This alone made my trip worth it! Not to mention the rest of the delish assortment of desserts! \n\nOne thing that you should be aware of is that the seafood buffet is only available on Fridays-Sundays for only 29.99. I unfortunately was not because I was ready to get my seafood fix during lunch on a Monday until they told us the reason why the lunch buffet was only $15 was because it's only on the weekends... Boohoo! Exactly why I took  a star off along with the next star because of their limited sushi bar that was not so great, which I wouldn't expect greatness at a buffet anyway, but they should have at least given more of a selection. The lamb shoulder however, was yum! \n\n$15 on weekdays for lunch, $22 for dinner... Same price for the weekends without seafood but with it's 29.99, which I think is a great price compared with the prices on the strip that's not as great... Belagio is still one of my faves!",378025

4,I am commenting on the super Bi-lo in Matthews on Fincher Farm lane.  The managers and sales staff are quite friendly and do go out of their way to assist you. They recently overcharged me on an item that was still advertised as buy one get one free but they made good and refunded all the  money plus I got to keep the item. Can't complain about that. I wish they did offer more gourmet items as Harris Teeter does but I like the shopping experience there and they do have good deals on lots of items that I buy frequently. That is why I keep going back.,420184

2,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for a Saturday night date. We were seated quickly by what appeared to be an owner. We'll call him \""The Boss\"" (tall man with a baseball cap on). The Boss sat us, bussed our table, wiped it down, and then gave us menus. Said our server would be with us \""shortly\"". \""Shortly\"" was the understatement of the year at this place. The Boss came back about 15 minutes later to ask us if we'd ordered drinks yet. We hadn't.  He ordered and brought us our drinks. 35 MINUTES LATER our waitress Morgan appeared. We'd been watching her serve the couple at the same table we were seated at and several tables near us for the past half hour. We ordered food. Entire order was wrong and Morgan didn't offer to take it back to have it fixed. We were also charged for food portions we didn't order as well as paid for the incorrectly prepared entree. We also watched the Boss seat a new couple next to us and get their drinks as well. The waitress finally asked if they needed new drinks/food an hour and ten minutes later after they had been sat. An hour. And ten minutes. Really? Really. The food here was amazing though. That's the only reason they got two stars. The boss was excellent as well. Hosting, bussing, serving, cleaning, and probably cooking. Food is great but good luck getting service!",420936

1,"Dr. Luoung  placed a crown on me which became infected and incredibly painful. He then did a root canal and  drilled through the new crown he had just put on, and then said that he would replace the crown since he basically destroyed it. I went back a little later for a cleaning and he did not mention replacing the crown he drilled through. Then the crown collapsed. I went to him and said that the crown collapsed. He said that I needed to make an appointment before this happened !!! He refused to replace the now destroyed crown, because it now needed an implant. I should have sued him for this but for some reason I felt it wasn't worth the time and cost, and just decided to go somewhere else and have it taken care of, at great expense anyway. It had to be extracted ,($400.00) and an implant put in. ($2400.00) He didn't live up to his word and refused to fix his shoddy work that caused the infection in the first place!!!  I wouldn't go to this guy if it was free. Horrible dentist who is only concerned about saving a buck, even if he is responsible for the screw up  !!! Look elsewhere.",256391
3,"If the Tropicana were placed basically anywhere but in Las Vegas, it could potentially be a 4 star hotel. \u00a0But because it's located right on the Vegas strip, it loses its allure against all the glitz and glamour.\n\nThis joint recently underwent a remodel, and while there's nothing special about the casino or rooms, they're clean (a necessity for me no matter where I go). \u00a0The two annoying things about my room are that my sink/tub soap was not always refilled and someone left a dirty hand towel hanging on the shower curtain rod that housekeeping must have missed (for God knows how long).\u00a0\n\nBottom line, would I return? \u00a0While Tropicana wouldn't be my first choice, if the price were right (or even free like on this sweet visit), sure - why not? \u00a0Plus I'm a sucker for a complimentary warm chocolate chip cookie (upon check-in, you'll get a coupon - two if you sweet talk the front desk!).",370306

To top it off, when we were digging through our purses trying to find cash, an employee told us to move because we were in the way.\n\nAND we wasted money on non-refundable parking just to leave 2 minutes later. That's probably how they make their money because how do they make any when they turn customers away? \n\nAlso the only bathroom is a Mr. John port-a-potty.

I've been here 3 times so far:\n\nVisit #1 - 2 cars ahead of me - took about 10 minutes and I considered just driving away but decided to stick it through\nVisit #2 - 0 cars waiting so I was in and out in like 1 minute.  It was perfect.\nVisit #3 - 1 car ahead of me.  Took over 10 minutes so I drove away.\n\nWith that said my tip to you is this:  If there are any cars waiting then just drive away because you may be waiting there all day.\n\nI don't know if it is me or what, but I think waiting 10+ minutes for coffee is ridiculous.  This isn't Starbucks with 27 cars in line.  With just 1 or 2 cars this place grinds to a halt.  I don't know what the problem is.  My guess is that they offer 75 things on the menu.  Tons of coffee drinks, smoothies, sandwiches, etc.  They need to trim their offerings down 90% and only offer the basics to get people in and out ASAP.\n\nHopefully my Keurig will be fixed soon but this place comes in handy if there is nobody waiting or you have the patience of a saint.",549035
2,"Food was excellent. Truffle mac & cheese = amazeballs. Dining in first class restaurants on a frequent basis, I was less than impressed with the attitude I was given when I arrived for our reservation. I was informed that due to the fact that we were a bit late for our reservation that they set a time limit as to when we needed to leave. This is absurd, especially for a group of us that spent over $1,000 on food alone...not including the alcohol. The vibe of the restaurant is trendy, and if I weren't trying to speak with my friends on the opposite side of the table, I wouldn't have been bothered by the extreme noise level. I typically do not complain about service at a restaurant, especially in Vegas, but I felt compelled to share my experience in hopes that they improve their blahzay client service. All in all, I was impressed by the food and overall vibe, however the hostesses need to check their attitude.",222939
1,"The hotel has a very confusing layout. Had to go to the back of the hotel to mess around with the parking. The parking garage is very small and confusing. The lobby was like entering a set of a 1970s tv show. Mirror chandeliers and out dated carpet. The check in line was very long and they only had 4 people checking guests in. I requested top floor and only got 17! I received 5749. I said there was no way that the room was on the 57th floor because the building didn't even look like it past 20 floors. We walked to the elevators which are beyond outdated. Scratched and scrapped up gold walls and Mirrors, doors and floors. I looked at the wall of buttons to push my floor and it had numbers 47-61? With arrows and other room numbers. I pushed 57 which is where my room was.  Got off and the sign in the hall said 17th floor but all the other signage says 57 but clearly we were not 57 stories high above the Vegas nightlife. It is extremely confusing and makes no friggin sense. That's all I ever heard the other guests complain about. The room we got was a \""luxury\"" in the \""renovated\"" Monoco tower. \""Renovated is an understatement! I think the last time it was update was in the 90's. The carpet on the halls was stained. The room doors are an old wood type very dark and ugly. The room was worse. It smells like mold as door are you open the door. The room was certainly not \""luxury\"" nor updated. The bathroom was terrible. Ugly old 1970's yellow bathroom tile and shower and old outdated bathroom fixtures. The shower head was the worst I ever had in a hotel. Everything in the room was dirty. The rugs the ceiling in the bathroom stains on the carpet. The desk and the pictures looked like it hadn't been dusted in years! The windows were absolutely disgusting and dirty. The view was pretty good except the view of the ugly buildings and dumpsters but overall it was a nice view. The bed was pretty comfortable I was surprised. The fridge didn't work and we had to tell them 3 times to replace it and they never did! We came one night and there was absolutely no parking! All the garages were filled and even valet was full! The one night we did valet the car it took almost 30 mins to get the car. And they were very short handed.  I didn't have any change to tip on me except a large bill so I went in the hotel to front desk and asked for change and the older lady told me no and I had to walk to the casino which was on the other side of the hotel to the cage to break it. Really? You can't give me some change? I'll never come back to this place. The casino was horrible. They advertise $1 blackjack and only have it On 1 table! Really? And they only had 3-4 other BJ tables but the min was $25. Really? The slots sucked and so did the players club which gave me a. $3.00 crappy shirt for joining and spending all my money in their hotel. The restaurants suck and are fast food places. Please update it. You can still have the history and old charm if you just update the dam place! Absolutely the worst! Save your time and energy and stay and play somewhere else!",133519

3,"I've just been getting into tea as of late, so I've never been to a tea room. Oh and I found out the \""tea\"" I like is not really tea...my bad.\nSo I'm grading this place as more of a cafe.\nIt fit well inside an antique mall, so you can work up an appetite or walk off all the finger sandwiches and scones. \nThe room is small but there was enough room not to feel cramped. We were initially sat in their back private room but there was not alot of air flow and the sun was heating the room through its large windows. The waitress was happy to move our party into the main room, much more comfortable. The room reminded me of my grandmothers house but with plastic lawn chairs for seating. Cute, random table clothes decorating the tables. Staff was friendly and attentive.\nThe boys in the group got sandwiches and ice tea or lemonade. The girls got \""High Tea\"". I got the Strawberry Tingler rooibos. It was probably the best tea I ever had. I started with the corn chowder, very tasty with lots of chunks of vegetables. The finger sandwiches were good, fresh made, I added a little bit of salt to enhance them, but I like salt. The tuna was probably my least favorite. I preferred the Chicken salad, egg salad, and cucumber sandwiches. The scones were offered in 3 different kinds...apricot was the best, the cherry sour cream cam in second, the coconut chocolate chip I thought would've been the best, but I was disappointed. The jam and cream they serve along side is a perfect accompaniment.\nIf your looking for a new experience, its an affordable treat.",422383

4,"I agreed with some of the post that say this restaurant offered the items you don't regulary see in most Thai restaurant.  The menu is big and has many variety kind of food from noodles, rice, steak, curries and salad depends on what mood you're in. Pictures on the menu is a big help to kinda give you the ideas of what the food will look like. They did a really good job on that.\n\nService is nice. In fact I got all the servers waiting on me.  Place is very clean and modern. The staffs were friendly and attentive. For a quick lunch it's nice to be able to grab 2-3 items food from what they called a la carte which is prepared food similar to Panda Express. The price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would recommend anyone who want to try their a la carte to get in before 1.30pm for fresh food. Otherwise if you get there later than that it seems like the food is old and had been sitting there for a while.\n\nI have no complain about the food here. Food is always good and full of flavor. They have the best Pad Thai ever! Must try! I tried to order something different everytime I go there. So far so good.\n\nI got a kick out of reading the review below that give Thai Cafe 1 star. Seems like this is their first time having Thai food and they have no idea what to order. I went there on Friday and saw the happy hour stand on the table that says $1 off appetizer/salad between 5-something and during the football game. Also the Thai beer was only $3. \n\nI've never heard of chicken in papaya salad before. If I'm wrong please let me know but I think you're mistaken it for something else? Papaya salad is very refreshing by the way.\n\nGinger salad is supposed to be grounded meat wasn't it? There was a picture on the menu I believe. I ordered mine with chicken. It had a very good flavor but too much ginger for me.\n\nOverall I have good experiences so far with this restaurant. It's our favorite Thai restaurant! Don't judge the place by the reviews, go try it yourself.",448914

We ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles and both dishes were to die for. Bacon strips placed inside of waffles?! How can you not be ok with that?? Bes thing ever. No complaints just super full bellies and an awkward waddle out the door. We had a 45 minute wait to be seated for a party of 5 but we just headed to O'Shea's downstairs to pass the time. Went by pretty quick and definitely worth the wait. The place is open 24 hours which is also a cool touch as it makes for great drunk and/or hungover food. Or just good food in general.

I'm local and I can tell you there are far better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. The prices were about double what I've seen and for that I would expect someone to care. We probably saw our server three times and we had to be the annoying people who asked other servers for drinks, forks, etc. I would suggest avoiding this place.",576685

If you are inside the Caesar Palace or in the vicinity and want chinese food, go to this place instead of the chinese place at the Forum food court. The food is pretty good. The specialty item is the handpull noodle with different topping, with the pork/mushroom as being the most popular. I did try that and was happy with it. I do eat in the San Gabriel valley a lot and I think this place is pretty good. The food cost anywhere from $9-$30 per dish, which is still cheaper than any other sit down chinese restaurants at the Bellagio, The Aria, or the Wynn. Red 8 at the Wynn is probably the best casual asian/chinese in the casino though.",369195

2,What a joke!   Their food is good. But the service I just had for lunch was atrocious.   Ordered my food with an iced tea.    Received the ice tea at the bar and then had to ask the bartender for sweetener.    As I looked around the place was nearly empty.   The bartender walks away and I don't see him for another 5 minutes or so.     My iced tea was empty after two minutes and when I looked around for someone to give a refill.   Surprise.  No one is around.    I had to wait until my food arrived from it looked like a cook to get a refill from someone other than the bartender.   Of course with no ice in it.    Nice room temperature to it.   He also had to get me silverware. \nFrankly I was less than impressed with the service.    It wasn't until halfway done with my meal that the bartender comes by with a cup of ice and a spoon to tell me. The ice melts fast.    Gee.  I think it really melts fast when their is no ice in the refill cup too.   \n\nI am only giving two stars for the food which I believe is 4+ stars.   I am going to stick with delivery and takeout.    If you want to get better service go next door to the Persian restaurant.   They at least check on their patrons.,242483

Our server, Aidin, approached us and recommended that we try their happy hour menu since we still had 30 minutes left. \n\nWhile we waited on our order we got chips, bean dip and salsa. I thought the salsa was ok, but the black bean dip and chips were great. We ended up ordering the Mini Tacos and Dynamite Beef Taquitos. The tacos were truly \""mini\"" but delicious!

The taquitos were also really good and came with a few dipping sauces. \n\nHonestly, I am a little surprised to see how low the ratings are for Lolita's (I didn't look at them before I went.)

1,"Terrible. \n\nMy spaghetti was overcooked and flavorless, the free wine was like vinegar (but what do u expect of free wine), the cappucino tasted like it came from a vending machine, the service was slow, and the old frail man on the accordian was kind of entertaining and cute until he asked for money.",131349
5,I've been going to Matt Martin for years! What he's capable of doing is nothing short of a miracle. Both of my teenage daughters go to him as well - they love all of his suggestions and the results. \n\nLove the new location too. Highly recommend The Parlor!,631496
4,"This is now my go-to Hawaiian place. I have tried the loco moco, the katsu loco moco, the ahi poke furikake style, short ribs, and the kalua pig and cabbage. All are better than what I've had at L&L BBQ or Aloha Kitchen and the portions are triple what you get at the other places. Great Service as well.",372240
4,"Since my daughters favorite food is sushi, this place has become a regular place for us. We've been coming here for a couple years now and love it. The staff is nice, and the food is good! The specials are almost always a welcome surprise! \nWe can always count on getting a quick bite no matter what time.",349159
2,"Standard food as with all locations. It was the service that ruined it when the order taker became so frustrated by me not wanting the drink that came with the kids meal. He was flustered and rude like I was inconveniencing him because we had our own water. It's 110 degrees out. \n\nAnyway, at least it was clean and the food filled us up.",254740
1,"Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \""multiple times\"" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \""Oh, you wanted another?\"" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated.",3589
1,"I love Apple products but I hate their retail customer service. \nI've been here several times and it's always a nightmare. \nThe \""geniuses\"" aren't really that bright and they don't care about customer service.

4,"Nothing says\""Welcome to Vegas\"" quite like a casino set up inside the airport!  It seems like as soon as you get off the plane you're hit with the blinking lights and ding ding of the slot machines.  \n\nBut seriously, let's get to the important part.  FREE Wifi!!!  Do I need to say anymore about that?\n\nThe other important part, the food choices.  I hate when the only thing offered in an airport is fast food options or sit down restaurants.  I want a nice balance that's fast and not fried.  There weren't many of those choices, unless you wanted to grab a pre-made sandwich from one of those corner grab and go stations.  Meh.  Good thing was you can scrounge up something and at least there are options.  I've been to some airports were there's hardly anything in the terminal you're parking it at for 2 plus hours.  Thee worst!\n\nAnother plus, it's literally minutes from The Strip.  Being from a city (Pittsburgh) that has an airport more than 20 minutes outside the city limits, that's a big plus!

4,"Came here on date night with another couple before the Cirque show. It was a Thurs... so the place was not that busy. \n\nFood was excellent. Appetizers were served quickly. Since we were all sharing, the waiter offered to add an extra shrimp to the cocktail - to make 4 (1 for each - they are BIG). He did the same for the other appetizers. Nice touch, made it so we all could have a little taste of each.\n\nFood is served entree and large \""\u00c0 la carte\"" sides - like any good restaurant should. We again split all the sides - with waiter making sure there was plenty for each.\n\nI ordered a margarita (rocks/salt) - came in a 'girly' wide-top glass. I did ask for a normal tall drink bar glass on my refills...waiter obliged with no problems.\n\nOverall - good place for an adult date-night. We will definitely go back.",328300
2,So I tried this place... Gave it a couple chances... But everything just seems off. Usually wrong ingredients in items... Or the food just tasting off. Yeah I really haven't been back and even though I drive by it I usually go home and cook myself... Good thing my mom taught me!,33542
1,"Very dissapointing. I went there last night with 3 friends. I waited for 15 minutes without anyone seating us and then we waited another 15 minutes at a table without anyone coming up to us, even to give us menus. We left. I really hope this place gets their act together. I live downtown and I want it to do well.",358634
5,"Still the best in my book. Over 100 visits in the last year and I've been going here for several years now. I've tried other places and they don't compare. The pho here is the best in the valley. I've been to 10 other places and none of them even come close. Not on flavor and certainly not on price. I've switched from the 48 to the 48b (I like the BBQ pork more) and I've gone to ordering a Bahn Mi every visit. \n\nMost other pho places, for 2 orders of pho and a couple appetizers, will run $30 for 2 people with tip. I'm consistently leaving Da Vang for $20 including a generous tip.\n\nThey are friendly, they refill your drinks continuously. They remember their regulars and our orders. What is not to like? The neighborhood? Get out of your hole! \n\n...Just don't use the east entrance... that incline is a killer! Use the entrance off the side street to the north. Your car will thank you.",93242

4,"I was looking for last minute hotels and stumbled upon The Riviera. I saw they had an offer one bed deluxe suite for 60.00 that included your living room with a wet bar, 2 bathrooms, a bedroom with a huge bed with a balcony with a decent view to the strip 60  a night sounded awesome.Then I read the reviews and was terrified and of course there was no refund if we cancelled. When we got there checking it wasn't as terrible like people said, but of course we got there at 6pm when check in was at 3pm but we checked in with no problem. We stayed on the Monte Carlo tower on the 26th floor, the one bedroom deluxe suite was very spacious the rooms are outdated but they're not THAT bad what really is in need of a renovation are the bathrooms. \nThe Riviera isn't the typical glamorous hotel you see at the middle of the strip, it's a blast from the past. I thought it was nice being able to experience a much older hotel, it's pet friendly also. Getting to our room wasn't such a long walk like in the other hotels. It's pretty far from all the shows but that's nothing a simple cab ride or a car ride can fix. This hotel isn't as packed as others it's very nice to walk around or catch a break from the night life. Overall it was a nice stay I enjoyed it staff was friendly, I hope they begin to fix their bedrooms soon and update many things (:\nIf you want an updated nice bedroom ask for the Monaco tower",133615
3,"I love the decor of this place! It's in an old church and there is a lot of history to the building, which can be seen on the walls. I do wonder how Jesus feels about alcohol being served in a once place of worship? C'mon! I had to wonder?! That wondered, I did not love the chips nor the salsa; that's kind of a make it or break it for me. The next thing was that we made it with 45min to spare on happy hour. Not paying attention, we ordered Margs on the rocks ... But later realized the marg on the happy hour menu was 'frozen' , NOT on the rocks. Hmm. Okay. So I guess I wasn't impressed with the fact that they are probably out of one of those slush pre-made machines. A good list of drinks though; just limited, VERY limoted on happy hour drinks. On to food; I had the Thai fish curry taco; a chicken and the duck taco. The duck stated that it had Brie cheese , but I was not able to prove that. I did like the taste of it but the fish was my favorite. Ordered the shoe string onions to go with and again, meh. To follow it up, they were out of all the desserts except two. We tried the lemon tarte and it reminded me of a 'not all the way cooked' pie, yet tasted like\nLemon meringue with no meringue. Weird. Ambience and staff great. But one sinner to another ..

1,"My husband and I walked in about 8:30 on a Wednesday night and asked for a table for 2.  The hostess was completely thrown that we had just walked in and didn't have a reservation.  As in, she really didn't know what to do.  As she sat there looking confused and looking around the restaurant, my husband suggested that we could grab a drink at the bar while she figured it out.  She looked relieved and went off to talk to a gentleman who worked there (we presumed about our seating).  \n\nMeanwhile husband ordered a martini, and I a glass of $18 wine.  At least it was a big pour.  The wine list was out of control expensive without being out of control excellent.  My baseline is Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label - in the local wine stores here, I can buy it retail for $35-40/bottle.  On this menu, it was $125.  After having a tremendous bottle of Rioja the night before at Stripsteak (at $85) that we were still reminiscing about while at the bar, we decided that by the glass was probably the best way to go.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we determined that our previous night's meal was so good, that neither of us would be opposed to going back if we weren't going to be seated by the end our our drinks.  Ten minutes later, husband paid the bar tab, the hostess was nowhere to be seen, and we took off for another delicious steak down the strip.",198291

We were OK with that because we had time. So you are in a hurry don't go . We get our food we were not impress at all. I had the chili rellano dinner , they cover it with some red sauce it taste like ketchup. The guacamole had no favor at all. After spending $100 for 3 meals, 6 beers, and one appetizer we just where not impress at all. On our way out we hear a great band, now they do have a great band .

2,"First of all don't buy more than one yelp coupon at a time cause you can only use one at a time and they stated that they prefer to give one ticket per table. Now I'm stuck with 2 more coupons that I probably won't use. The salsa was a little hot for me but the chips were fresh and delicious. We got the cheddar quest and it was delicious as well. I was very exited for the creamed corn side dish and it was a little hot for me but was delicious and I ate it even though my nose was running from it. I ordered the quesadilla and it was just basically plain chicken and cheese. Finally something not burning my mouth. My dinner guests had the Barbacoa burrito, which was huge, and the tilapia Cesar salad which looked good. Everyone ate all of their food! The service is where this place goes down hill. Had to wave her down for everything and wasn't overly friendly. If your going for the food it's pretty good just don't go there looking for the best service.",485441

2,"Upon my recent stay, I was disappointed that the night manager upon check-in did not honor my marquis suite upgrade for a discounted rate when booked months prior to my stay. He charged me the full amount for a room upgrade and reasoning was because the hotel had less then 10 rooms available the day of check-in despite all the marquis suite's being unbooked. When I spoke to the day manager the next day, he pretty much hinted that the hotel didn't want to honor their room upgrade and wanted more money. Why offer a discounted upgrade in the first place. This honestly was my favorite hotel in Vegas. This is no longer the case.",276174

Sure you don't get the Vegas scene, but you also probably get better service, similar quality and a whole lot more money in left your pocket.  The only brief star of the night was the hostess stand.  Friendly to a fault, they patiently waited for my entire party of 6 a full 30 minutes after the reservation time - and they didn't punish us with a poor table or attitude.  The server was fair - guests at my table had to ask who they had to bribe to get their beer delivered - but what do you expect on a Sunday night at 8pm.....hmmm.  BTW - this restaurant is so noisy you can barely hear people at your own table.  Good luck.",162199

We can't say anything bad about this place.\n\nThe food is not typical Italian - it's Italian, but with a South Philadelphia flair.  Everything was very good - I don't know how much else I can say.  The tomatoes in the Caprese tasted like tomatoes.  The cheese (both Mozzarella and Ricotta) are made in house.  The meatball is to die for.  The desserts were good.\n\nOur waiter, Ben, was as good as they come - really - his service made our experience perfect.",435196
4,"Went to see local bands play here last night with Amy D and her awesome friends.  Totally my kind of bar...dark, dirty, divey, and with killer bands playing.  Very spacious...but that could have something to do with the fact that the place wasn't really packed. \n\nI didn't drink this night, but I did notice that Budweiser was $6.  (Not a beer drinker, but that seems a little high, I think)  But somebody was buying the drinks.  I think last night was the first time I actually had a guy fall on top of me.

1,"Fran's has one of the most ambitious menus in Charlotte. Unfortunately, the execution of the menu is decent at best, extremely subpar at worst.  Yes, they have the famous bacon-wrapped tater tots... but by the time they arrived at our table the tots were cold and the maple glaze has solidified into a gooey mess. As a main, I had the meatballs, which had a good taste, but once again were not hot enough. My friend ordered a salad and opted to get the grilled shrimp. For $5 she got three shrimp, which isn't a bad deal, I guess. But it kicked the cost of the entire salad to $12, and it wasn't worth it at that price.\n\nThe service was OK. Our server was friendly, and while he didn't apologize for the slow service or cold food, one got the feeling that it wasn't his fault and the kitchen was having issues. And this was well after the place opened, when most places have all the issues figured out. I'm guessing that the chef is a control freak who insists on doing everything herself, even though food quality suffers for it.",410723
3,"First of all, make sure you are coming from the west because trying to enter this place from the east is very difficult. Also, their parking lot is pretty small and difficult to maneuver. I decided to try this place because I kept passing it on my way to work and I remember seeing all the good reviews about it. I decided to order 2 donuts and asked if I could sub out the milk for the orange juice (combo #3), and you would've thought I had asked for free donuts. Unfortunately, I can't drink milk, so I thought it would be no problem to swap it out for oj (especially considering the milk was more expensive than the oj). Fine, I'll just get the donuts. I get up to pay, and find out my order has to be $2.50 or more to use a debit or credit card (mine came to $1.93). So I end up grabbing an oj, making it more expensive than if they had let me do the combo! Now for the donuts...I got a Boston Cream (my favorite), and it was not great. The donut itself and the chocolate were ok, but the cream on the inside was just gross. The sugar donut was ok, but again, not great. I will probably not be coming here again.",396893
2,"Terrible, awful, rude service. Don't bother asking general questions about the food. The waiter seemed annoyed when I asked how many lbs is the lobster and how much per pound. Just two questions about the food. I'm sorry I want to know how many lbs and don't want a surprise bill. He didn't tell me the price so I ordered something else. WTF? Doesn't a restaurant want their customers to order one of the market price entrees? I guess not. \n\nWhile I was ordering, he seemed annoyed, snooty (lol, ok Mr. waiter) and rushed me while taking my order. I know I shouldn't expect much from a Chinese restaurant but there are other Chinese restaurants with decent service. The food was average. I'm glad I didn't get impressed with their food. Yup. I would NOT come back.",72529

The eggs were done perfectly, the Canadian bacon wasn't overcooked and was a thick slice, and they put just enough sauce.

I've never had them fried before; my husband prefers it this way.  I prefer it boiled since it's creamier.  Service was indifferent but quick.  Prices were cheap.

2,"Claustrophobia galore! My boyfriend and I had reservations for his birthday and we were scared of hitting someone with the door! Raku is a small restaurant with tables so close to one another that it's not only  difficult to move around but it is challenging to have an intimate dinner with those you love. The portions and price ratio are somewhat outrageous! (Small, dinky portions and it costs a lot!) Can't say I was too pleased with my time here.\n\nIn my personal opinion, this place is overrated. My friend had glorified this place like no other and even the yelp ratings confirmed his love for this place. Unfortunately, I can't say the same :(. I expected this place to be so very close to how the yakitori places are in Japan. This place definitely falls short. \n\nDespite my disappointment, I must say, I was impressed by the quality and the menu. However, for the price and atmosphere, I don't see this as a worthy place to dine in. We ended up getting a few skewers of meat; I know we got the wagyu beef which definitely stood out, the tofu (the best thing I had on this menu) and grilled tako. No bueno on that grilled tako; I felt as if I was chewing on a rubber chicken that was burnt flavored. Blah! I honestly don't know why this place is highly rated; it's between \""good\"" and \""ok\"" but it isn't \""OMG this place is the s**t!\""\n\nI really tried to love this place. I tried to accept and tried to convince myself that I'm paying for high quality food, but seriously, this place is almost an insult. I had to stop at $85 worth of food because I wasn't sure how much I would need to spend to feel full and satisfied. I'm sad I wasted my hard earned money here and couldn't give my boyfriend an awesome birthday dinner. Vegas needs to step up their game on authentic yakitori places.\n\nPS. if you decide you want to go to Raku, I suggest not walking in as you are unlikely to get a table as a walk in. So make sure you try and get a reservation...",320859

3,"Mmmmm.  Popcorn.  Many, many flavors of popcorn.  Sweet, savory.  Chocolate, nuts.  Buttery, salty.  All of it.  And MPK does it well.  I love that they offer mini bags ranging from $2-$6.  Forced portion control.  If I was given a barrel of popcorn, I would somehow manage to get it down.\n\nSo why only 3 stars?  Less than impressive customer service.  Now the lady at the front (owner?) is great.  Very helpful and friendly.  The girls in the back...not so great.  I was in before Christmas to buy 13 mini bags...all different.  Although there were numerous people in the back, there seemed to be more socializing than actual work going on.  It took a good 20 minutes or so to get my order ready.  I could have eaten the product faster than they packed it.  No worries.  The shop is fun to browse.  But when my order was finally ready and I was heading out the door, an employee came out with a bag that they had missed.  At this point, I knew they probably did not bother to double check my order, so I did it when I got to my car.  Even with the bag they missed, I was still missing one...a $6 bag at that.\n\nAgain, the lady at the front was very apologetic, but the gal working in the back was argumentative as she \""knew\"" she had packed that particular flavor.  She came out front to get my entire bag, so that she could go through it herself and see what was missed.  Apparently, I am both a liar, illiterate, and unable to count to 13.  So now I'm waiting again with nothing to do but wonder why they didn't do this before they gave me the order.  Finally, she was sufficiently convinced the missing bag was, indeed, missing.  Upon returning my order, she remarked it had been packed, but not given to me.\n\nI still might not have dropped my rating if not for the fact that while I was waiting for the sleuth in the back to solve her case, another customer came in complaining that she was missing 5 bags of her 20 bag order.  Unfortunately for her, the order was for an office function that had already taken place.\n\nSo moral of my long-winded review is to give MPK a shot if you're a popcorn lover, but make sure you check your order before you leave.  They won't.",563189
5,"This place gets 5 stars alone for having my favorite Jamaican rum which I discovered on my honeymoon and can never find at restaurants or bars except the bar at my house.  \n\nJust to echo everyone below, great bread, great toppings for the bread (I wonder why he calls the place Olives.....) and nice view of the fountains.  \n\nI started with a sausage flatbread/pizza that I shared with others at the table.  For the main course I went with a veal chop which was great.  We had to rush though because we were going to see \""O\"" right after dinner.  (By the way, O was a BIG letdown.  I've seen several other Cirque shows, was most looking forward to this and totally disappointed.)",173933

3,"Sherwin Williams paint is great! We tried a regular home maintenance paint, but found out that Sherwin Williams paint is worth the price you pay. I've been here multiple times and there has always been one guy working the counter...which makes for a really long wait. They aren't very good at answering their phone too so don't bother calling because if its just that one guy working then he doesn't have time to answer. They have everything you need here to paint and their paint selection/colors is extensive. You can always choose to go with their low VOC paint, but I really couldn't tell the difference between the smells from when we painted one room with their low VOC to their regular paint. They also offer discounts from time to time, so I would check online or wait for their 30% off all paints and supplies!",149168

4,"This place is right across the street from my new job which I started about 2 months ago. I have ventured across the street about once a week during this time and have grown pretty fond of Arizona Sandwich Co.  This place surely beats the hell out of Subway which isn't saying that much but I rather pay the extra two bucks to eat here every time. My two favorites are the Sparky (turkey, bacon, and avocado) and the hot pastrami. I get my hot pastrami with jalapenos and not pickles because hey what can I say, I like it hot.",460714
2,The epitome of average\n\nAvoid the mall food please and go somewhere better like Grilled Ave or Tokyo House. I ordered a very subpar spicy tuna roll with dried out fish mixed with sriracha and rolled pretty sloppily. What the beef bowl lacked in flavor it made up in chewiness and portion. (Great for people who want jaw workouts!)\n\nAnywho if you want better food and are willing to drive about 5 min away theres better places right on the Lightrail/Tempe Campus.,568710
1,"BIRTHDAY FOR HUBBY UGH\nFirst of all I booked this on Priceline, I booked a room with a separate living space. It did not happen that way at checkin. WE WERE actually given a standard room.\n\nWe also called the hotel directly on May 10th, to verify the bedding would be hypo allergenic (no goose or down at all), I requested a fridge for a medical need, and a baby crib too. I was also promised a beech credit of 50. I recorded the call to verify all was ready to go.\n\nWe selected the M BAY for the pools, shark reef exhibit, and the it being on the end of the strip, with the boys. \n\nWhen we arrived it took one hour and thirty minutes to check in. No help with our bags. After the checking in the issues and more concerns piled up, only to not be resolved in a timely manor, or only after asking for the same item more than once. If it even was resolved at all.\n\n\nThe standard room, was dirty.\n1. Hair on bed and pillows.\n2. Toilet had number 2 stains in it.\n3. Snack tray was there, but item was open gross I am hoping no charge for that.\n4. Wrong bedding\n5. there was no way I was going to stay in the wrong room either.  I spoke to the main desk. who promised us help quickly. \nWe Waited for the agent we spoke to to come move us he did not?\n6. We called guest services again and then were told to hold by Rachel. She spoke To agent one and said he actually would not move us right away and that the wait was not too bad, and then stated the first agent had to get permission from the supervisor to help us. However he did not and was unable to call us back in the whole forty minutes we waited.\n3. All of a sudden the crib shows up, and he tries to put it in the room. Unfortunately that is when I called back to the desk, as we were moving rooms or so I thought. \n\nTHE SECOND ROOM WAS WORSE.\n1. The view was nice, but that's all.\n2. It was still the wrong room, as it had no king and no separate bed for the kids, no living space, and no baby crib, or fridge, \n3. Dirty headboard with white fluid on it? I have the pictures. The room smelled like smoke, and would have to wait for bedding to be changed. \n4. Called and spoke to The only assistant night manager, who was awful his name was TREA, (Trey).\n\nHE WANTED TO JUST HAVE US WAIT IN THE FILTH AND HAVE A MAID EVENTUALLY CLEAN THE ROOM. I WAS NOT ABLE TO ALLOW THAT WITH OUR  KIDS AND US. THE ROOM WAS REALLY NOT CLEAN AND WAS IN ITS OWN RIGHT A HEALTH HAZARD. WE WERE EVEN TOLD TO STORE MEDS IN MINI BAR.\n\n\nANOTHER ISSUE, we took our bags to the bell desk as the assistance never came to the room to help load them. I was so upset I ended up talking to TK as I refused to talk to TREA. He had us store our bags at the bell desk.We then had to leave our bags at the bell desk while again they tried to fix the room cleanliness issue, and get us into the correct the room. I brought down my iPad to guest services and showed TK the booking to make sure it would run smoothly. He said it would be correct and that the crib and fridge would be in the room and cold when we got back. The only thing is we would have to have call down for our luggage when we get back to the room later. All of this took at least another hour and a half if not more.\n\nROOM THREE - WORSE YET AFTER RETURNING AT TEN AT NIGHT, \nwe came back to the room only to be shocked by just a king bed. where does my older son sleep!  Where does the baby sleep. \n\n NO BABY CRIB NO FRIDGE. WE HAD JUST REPLACED THE MEDS FROM CVS.  Which one expensive fix. It was still the wrong room. I called down to guest services again, and was told they can't get another room right now, but could get us or correct room tomorrow. They left us in a jam and we were forced to take the room as is. Tub was dirty too. The baby crib did not show up after three calls and closer to midnight, and the rollaway bed that was promised for our older son never came. The fridge came before the baby crib at 11:39 PM. I was very upset at this point. \nAs soon as the baby bed came, everyone crashed. My poor husband in a chair as we did not have enough beds for us. A great way to spend his birthday trip sleeping, waiting and asking for help with issues. \n\nTHE FORTH ROOM, \nFINALY THE CORRECT ROOM, MY HUSBAND HIMSELF MOVED US IN WITH WHAT HE COULD CARRY AND WAITED FOR THE REST OF OUR LUGAGE TO ARRIVE. he waited forty minutes. The fridge never came, the baby bed had to asked about two times, but the room was right. Crappy view beyond what vegas should have, literally faces another wall, and when you look down there is a ton of pipes and bird poop. AGAIN I HAVE A PICTURE. \n\n\nHERE IS WHAT WE WRE PROVIDED\n\nCRAPPY FLOOR SERVICE WHILE AT THE CASINO, got one drink in two hours plus.\n\nA SHARK REEF VISIT ON THEM, AND a 100 dollar credit. We also requested a late check-out do to our super late check-in and all the room changes. \n\nIT IS NOT WORTH IT TO STAY HERE. I WOULD RATHER GO TO THE RIO, or the hard rock.\n\nWE want is a complete refund of time, to book someplace else without stress. \nLOVE RIO!",171953

The way it's constructed and the way it works are both mind-boggling.  \n\nThe entire show is gorgeous, and I even bought the soundtrack afterward.  During some Cirque shows, there is a lack of action around the main performance.  However, this is not the case here.  There might actually be too much side action!  I couldn't decide where to focus my eyes, and i was constantly scanning the stage for interesting characters and acrobatics/theatrics.\n\nThe only downside is that we came to the later show after a VERY filling (and wonderful) meal at Le Cirque, and midshow we were both drowsy.  I was having trouble staying awake, and the boyfriend was just about completely out.  So....I think both of us missed a great deal of the performance, which is upsetting, but was unavoidable.",181693

Room large, free coffee and water in the room, free internet, bathroom with a tv in the mirror (hey, I watched tv while drying my hair - that's luxury!). Only thing missing was a robe - and I thought they provided robes in the room to borrow? Maybe I dreamed that?\n\nHad a late flight and since I had to check out of my room hung out in the bar area. Had snacks to eat and since it was happy hour had a couple glasses of red wine. Still got my free internet so I could wrap up business and not be days behind when I got back home. Waiter very polite, kept my water glass full, and brought me food and wine in a timely manner. Great way to end my business trip.\n\nSituation at the bar - couple had a loud and rambunctious child.

I kid you not, 4 guys at the bar, yes, busy, but not one bothered to acknowledge anyone who wanted to order that they will be right with you. I looked at the menu to see what kind of shakes they had. They had a $9.50 Milkshake. I thought, hey, if I'm going to get a drink, I should get one with alcohol. So, I ordered my Cosmo $16.70!! That was insane. Everyone was pissed, walking out, more people were coming in, I gave them a heads up that the service sucks and that you'll be waiting a long time. I had plenty of time to talk to those who were waiting and  warned them, since I wasn't going to leave until I finished the last drop of my drink!",382351

5,"Their are no words to express our gratitude to the staff of A Thyme for all Seasons. \n\nMy family and I found this outstanding place through yelp looking for a venue to hold our mom's surprise birthday party. With our first visit , after church on a Sunday morning we decided to have breakfast and was happily greeted immediately. The room was bright, very clean, and welcoming. \n\nThey had a great selection on their menu. Different thing's you wouldn't find anywhere else.  Like breakfast nachos (which is one of my favorites) The food came out fast, fresh, hot, and very delicious staff constantly checked up on us and our drinks never went empty. \n\nThe family and I decided that this was the perfect place for our mom's party. With months leading up to it we would have our Sunday morning breakfast here and never had an incident that we were disappointed.\n\nA few days before the party, they got together with me to discuss decorations.\n\nLet me tell you that the staff went above and beyond my expectations.\n\nThe party was a BLAST!!  More than 85 people could do nothing but say what a great place this was, especially with the birthday girl :)\nThe food, decorations, staff, DJ, bartender ... everything was tremendous!!\n\nThe place is roomy, delightful, and super clean. If you are looking for a place that puts good quality in their food this is the place. But if you are going to critique over decor... come on now... get a life!! It's perfect the way it is and you don't find many places that pride themselves with the delicious food they serve.\n\nThank you so much to \"" A Thyme for all Seasons\"" especially Mr. Michael, Ms. Monica, and Ms. Laura... you guys are the best and better than any party venue in town!!

2,"We stayed at Paris in April for 7 nights.  The room and restaurants are great.  Prices are reasonable.  The housekeeping staff is wonderful, never had an issue.  On our 5th night we were dismayed that the guests in the room next to us were smoking an \""illegal substance\"" and the aroma/smoke was coming into our room.  I've never had this problem in any other hotel stay and had to complain.  We explanined that we are drug tested by our employer and it was a problem.  It was 11 pm and the only solution they had was to move us!!  We had to pack up all of our belongings and relocate.  They wouldn't ask our neighbors to cease their behavior.  When we complained the next day about the inconvience the front desk told us to fill out a comment card.  I've never been so disregarded!!!!!",161991
4,"My second trip ever to the Stratosphere, and I still like it.  Sure, it's not a five star mega-casino a mile down the strip, but it's actually affordable.  The Deuce stops right outside the casino near the buffet and runs from Fremont Street to the Mandalay, with enough stops in between to get you where you want to go.  As for the surrounding area, you can actually walk outside and get a decent price on some food, or a bottle of liquor, for those looking to enjoy Vegas on a budget.  The rides were okay, the Big Shot being the only must do, but the views are awesome and the place is nowhere near as crowded as most of the strip casinos.  I highly recommend the strat, particularly the upgraded Select rooms.  My only negative applies to all of Vegas, as I am a non-smoker.  Nothing is more ridiculous than watching 50 people walk through a casino get irritated as they walk by one idiot chain smoking at a slot machine.  Eventually Vegas will realize most Americans do not indulge in this disgusting habit and ban it in public venues.  Until then though, we'll just have to suffer if we want to visit.",153525
2,I'm not saying this to be mean but what my inexperienced waitress did to me was comical and not excusable. I DO NOTE I am NOT basing my review on what she did and only the food but I feel it needs to be told so you see the whole picture.\n\nShe took our order and soon came to deliver the drinks . Her tray had three beverages a water an iced tea and a soda. Somehow she sorts of looses her balance and almost lost the water and it spills ON ME with Iced cubes hitting me but she manages to save it before it all splashes me. She said she was sorry but she suggested to ME TO CLEAN THE TABLE WITH THE PAPER TOWEL MYSELF! It's bad enough that she couldn't be bothered to clean that up but what really made it WORST was she left the wet napkin on the table the whole time we were dining. I do note she was very youthful and might have been only 15 or 16 years old so I have to chalk it up to that but I also note the cooks on the night I was here were also very youthful looking and I might not have experienced the food as it was meant to be prepared.\n\nWe started out with very average house salads and fried pickles appetizer. The salads seemed fresh and the dressing seemed bottled tasting and not so good. I thought the pickle appetizer was inedible not because of them being wet laden with oil but because of how overly salted they were. My husband who tolerates more salt than me didn't think inedible but he felt too that they were over salted and he ate only a few.\n\nOur two plates arrive and my husband got nearly everything they make on his plate and asked me to try stuff I didn't have. I only tried his short rib and had to stop there because it was DRY and almost cold. (YUK!) so then I moved on to my plate. I tried the BBQ'd Turkey first. It was almost good with good flavors and not too much sauce. I also liked that the sauce wasn't too sweet but like the Rib it was dry and almost cold. (YUK! again) So I figure maybe the chicken is good but I was WRONG again. (YUK!) Another almost COLD and VERY DRY. I really hate dry chicken. I had a nice looking side of vegetables but sadly they were ruined by a generous hand of BUDGET SEASONING SALT that tasted awful. Lastly I was hoping the corn bread would be ok but I WAS WRONG AGAIN and SADLY it was so dry and so from the box tasting even soaking it in honey butter couldn't fix it.\n\nI do note my husband said the store purchased hot link wasn't as dry as the BBQ'd other items. He also said the pork ribs were better than the beef rib. I also need to say  I hope that the day time crew prepares the food in the way the owner meant it to be. I say that because of the numerous BBQ awards they've earned that I saw here while dining. But.......\n\n\nOnly one word.......... \n\nPITIFUL,52564

2,"This place was a Mega Cafe, a Coco's and Mi Tierra, prior to becoming Fiesta Chips and Salsa.\n\nI don't think they will be around long, Mi Tierra had much better food, at much more reasonable prices. Mi Tierra charged $7.50, including taxes, for a beef chimichanga, sides of rice and beans, with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo on the side, with iced tea. Chips and Salsa charged $12.00, including taxes, for a burrito with a little shedded lettuce and a small slice of tomato on the side, with iced tea. As I said, if Mi Tierra, selling better food at lower prices, went out of business, I don't thinks Chips and Salsa stands a chance,\n\nThat being said on with the Yelp:\n\nThey start you off with chips and salsa, no surprise there. However, you would think with the name Chips and Salsa, they would have good chips and salsa, they don't. The chips were cooked wrong, they were cooked at too low a temperature for too long. The result was over cooked, on the edge of burnt, oily chips. The chips were so oily, they were shiny, as if someone poured oil over them. The salsa was okay, nothing to write home about. With salsa in their name, you might think they would have brought a variety of salsas for the chips, (Mi Tierra brought two kinds of salsa and bean dip to go with the chips, while you were deciding on what to order and while they prepared it.).\n\nI had a Grande Meat Burrito (carne asada), it was okay,  Carne asada, rice, cheese, beans and pico de gallo, in a flour tortilla, though I didn't notice any cheese. It was not served with any sauces, I would think a place with salsa in it's name would want to showcase their salsas, guess not. Although size is relative, the grande burrito was closer to medio, than grande.\n\nWhile there I heard several complaints from people, on the lines of \"" there's suppose to be guacamole served with this\"" or \"" I specifically ordered this with the sauce on the side, they put the sauce on it and tried to scrape it off'\"". So apparently the kitchen doesn't know what's on their menu or how it's served and have trouble with simple requests. I assume the servers corrected the mistakes, but it's always more impressive to get it right in the first place. As near as I can tell, I got what I ordered, so it appears I was lucky. The server checked to see if I needed anything else, refilled my tea, etc. so I have no problem with the service side. I gave an extra star for the server, a girl with dark red hair, or they would have gotten a one star.\n\nThere are too many good Mexican restaurants in town, to settle for what they offer at this one. I won't be back.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAngie M.commented, \""hey wen did u went to fiseta and chips salsa and wht time   u should talked to the main manger \"" [sic]\n\nIn my response to Angie, I took the time to translate into English, corrected the spelling of fiesta, corrected the business name and answered her questions.\n\nQue lastima (what a shame), this may account for the mistakes people were having with their orders.",639622

1,"If you don't like having smooth, relaxing craps, and pleasure yourself in hot, anus ripping diarrhea, then look no further- Basha on Sherbrooke and University is the place for you!\n\nThis lovely little toilet nightmare is placed in the basement suite of an old, semi-abandoned office building, sharing its prime real estate with a shady currency exchange store that opens for only 3 hours a day and a Tim Hortons above it that, for lack of a better word, is as pleasurable in dining as is eating the asshole an obese computer technician named Fred.  The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.\n\nThe food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights.",337877

But certain changes recently are bumping down my rating.\n\nThe good\nMost of the food is delicious. My favorite is the vegetable tempura soup. Their happy hour is extremely affordable. Very cheap sake bombers. My husband likes the sushi rolls on happy hour. I'm not a fan of the vegetarian choices for happy hour. The sweet potato fries aren't very good. They don't have any veggie rolls on special for happy hour (c'mon veggies are cheaper than fish!) so I end up ordering my favorite roll, the veggie tempura roll, off the menu. It is always super tasty. The servers are sooo nice. They can be a little slow and forgetful when the restaurant is busy but they are too nice and genuine to get mad at them.\n\nThe bad\nAs I mentioned I usually order the veggie tempura roll for happy hour, even though it is not happy hour priced. Well, one roll isn't enough for me to get filled up so up to 2 months ago, I would order a side of PLAIN fried rice. Their fried rice is yummy. It was only about a cup full but it was perfect accompaniment to one veggie roll. Last time we went in for happy hour I tried ordering my usual veggie roll and SIDE of fried rice. The server looked at me with guilty eyes and said \""Oh, we can't do that anymore.\"" He said if I wanted to order fried rice I would have to order the $8 fried rice entree. The fried rice entree has an option of chicken or beef, which is probably why it is a whopping 8 bucks. I'm a vegetarian who just wants some damn fried rice without any meat but I am not going to pay $8 for just rice. The server said the manager put an end to the restaurant offering it as a side. Talk about nickel and diming! How cheap can you get? It's RICE! Apparently, the manager made a couple of other changes that the staff and patrons are not crazy about. \n\nUnfortunately, these small changes are making a huge impact on how often we will patronize Eastwinds.

4,I always see this place every time I drive by so I decided to stop and try it out.. \nGood very fresh,575466
1,"The first time I went we had a big group and plenty of conversation so we didn't really mind the slow service.  The flat breads were all great as were the tacos.  The pulled pork sliders were a little weak, but the food was very good overall.  The second time the horrible service reared its ugly head.  My girlfriend and I sat down and just under 20 minutes went by and no waiter came to see us.  The one guy I saw was absurdly overworked.  The poor kid seemed to have 10 tables and was bussing his own tables as well.  When we left the manager seemed genuinely apologetic and tried to offer us an appetizer.  I just can't give my business to a place like this when there are plenty of restaurants in the city that are hustling to earn our business.  I like the food, but the atrociously slow service is too much to bear.",497319
5,"First - A few things I think we can all agree on about the Fry Bread House (East)\n\nYes its kind of a hole.\nYes they are stingy with their soda (50 cent refills... really?)\nYes their staff can be a little....  independent\n\nNow something folks might disagree on about the Fry Bread House (East):\nThey serve the best fry bread on earth and deserves a 5 star rating even if they decide that folks in line need to be regularly beaten.\n\nI've had fry bread from all over this state.  You can get it at the state fair, various restaurants, roadside stalls, a yellow school-bus in the parking lot of Mazatzal casino, there's even a guy in mesa who sells it out of his driveway.  None of it compares to what they sell here - its just stunningly good.\n\nGet a \""Taco\""  for lunch and then get a sweet one for desert - you can buy em both at the same time they'll toss the desert one in whenever you ask.",414392
4,This is the mall I go to when its to hot to visit Town Square or for something different. They have alot of stores I like and the food court is nice. They even have a toddler play area there..which can be handy after a few hours of your little one being in a stroller.\nDuring Easter they have a cute bunny for the kids to take pix with but @ Xmas the Santa is better @ Town Square. He has his own house there.\nI still manage to get here every couple of weeks and usually leave with a bag from somewhere..,278159
4,"We were looking to try something new in the area and this was one of our many bookmarked places that had some great Yelp! feedback, so away we went! The restaurant itself was really nicely laid out and had plenty of space for groups from small to large. We were seated right away and our server let us know he'd be with us shortly.  \n\nAfter looking over the menu for a bit, we both decided on our picks. I opted for the Hickory burger with a side of the baked potato soup, which was the soup of the day special. The burger was cooked to the medium I ordered, and had two healthy sized slices of Canadian bacon on top of it. The shredded cheddar was the big winner for me on this burger. The portion sizes are huge here, so be prepared to eat a ton, or get a box!\n\nOur server was really nice and took the time to answer a couple questions we had about the menu since both the husband and I have food allergies. The pricing is a bit high for options other than burgers / sandwiches, but the portion sizes are huge and the service is great, so for a nice date night out, it's a good option!\n\nOverall: A\nGood burger, nice server, and huge portions!",107276
3,"Very loud, and overwhelming environment.  Personally I found it rather stressful, I guess it depends on your tastes.  The food was reasonably priced and tasty.  A good place to take kids, since the noise would easily drown out any tantrums they might throw.  I guess that is a positive, right?",590872
4,"I've stayed here twice but the last time I stayed was a couple of weeks ago as part of my honeymoon. The check-in line was long and kinda dragged, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Everything else was great. \n\nThe lady checking us in upgraded our room for free since we mentioned we were on our honeymoon. We got a spa room, which is just a room with a hot tub in it. I LOVED the view from the room! We were on the 33rd floor with a great view of the strip. The bed was comfortable, the hot tub was great and I loved the fact that there weren't a lot of rooms on our floor. We didn't hear much activity up there and felt like we had the whole floor to ourselves. \n\nWe ate at a few different places while we were there. We knew to stay away from America since a lot of people got sick there, according to a few reviews. I tried the buffalo wings and fries from the Sportsbar restaurant (I can't recall the name). The wings were ok but instead of dipping the wings in the buffalo sauce, they cooked them in it so they came out a bit dry. Still pretty good if you dip them in ranch. The fries were really good! We had one order of the regular fries and one order of the parmesan fries. Get the regular fries. My husband got the sliders. They were ok. \n\nWe then tried a place that was famous for it's burgers. I can't recall the name of this place either but you can't miss it since it's around the same area as the Sportsbar place and they literally have all kinds of burgers. It's their thing. I really liked that place. The burgers were good!! The service there was awesome. The waiter we got was very attentive and made sure we always had our glasses full. \n\nAs for the gambling, I don't gamble much but I did play a few of the slots. They were ok. \n\nOverall, I would stay here just because the rooms are comfy and I always get a room with a nice view.",160864
4,"So I stayed at Encore last year for CES and the place had just opened. Didn't have a great experience. They lost my luggage the first night when I left it with the bell boy, checking out was a nightmare, ordering food and having basic things in the room (like a pen) proved too difficult... but I must say they redeemed themselves this year.\nI stayed in the tower suites this time around for CES and would highly recommend it. The suite is huge... 2 bathrooms, a massage room, living room, bedroom... way more space than I needed. The staff were very sweet, the concierge was great with reservations and checking out was very easy. The separate entrance is key if you don;t have a limo because it makes getting a cab much easier (and you avoid the ludicrous lines that exist at the main casino entrance) and check out is much faster. \nThe gym fee is a little ridiculous but that's just standard Vegas so it's not specific to Wynn/Encore.  \nLast thing -  one day the maid threw out bags that I had left in the middle of my bathroom... she thought they were trash. Except they contained the shoe bags and receipts from several pairs of beautiful new shoes I had bought. She threw them out by accident. Obviously I was pissed... but they were very professional dealing with it and went back the store and sent up 5 sets of Louboutin and Sergio Rossi covers after they realized what had happened (and who am I kidding... I wasn't going to return the things :) Throwing out the bags - not cool - but the way they dealt with it was very professional and very much appreciated. \nOverall, I like Encore more than Wynn and it is definitely one of my go to hotels when i go to Vegas.",321796

4,"This was my second stay at this location and I was treated very well. \nUpon checking in, the manager taking me to my room to the massage at their spa I felt pampered beyond belief. The pools are great, the cabanas are snazzy and the restaurants served us well. I had a great rate, got tons of points and enjoyed all aspects of the resort.",360637
1,"While the shoe quality is excellent, their ordering practice is extremely poor.\nTwo pair of shoes were ordered on 12/30/13.  \nThree calls were placed after assurance of delivery on 1/3/14.  I was told bad weather, death, very busy time of year, lack of help....\nI was told the order was not placed until 1/6/14 on 1/14/14.  \nPlenty of opportunity was given for this company to fess up and simply state they were incapable of processing the order in a timely manner.  \nI was offered a refund.  Another irritating factor,   Foot Solutions processed the credit card immediately on 12/30/14.   Unfortunate they were not as speedy on delivery.",528429
5,My family and I ate here on 9/11/2014 for the first time. I will cut to the chase and just say this place is delicious. I ordered the kebabs and my brother got the Gyro Plate with an appetizer hummus/pita. The flavors are wonderful and the salad dressing is oh so tasty. The owners were nice and lets just say we will be back to eat here again. I will be bringing my own container to buy that wonderful dressing for home :),428044
1,Ordered delivery Pizza was disgusting. Hot wings were disgusting. Price was outrageous in comparison to the quality. Cookie desert burn on the outside undercooked on the inside. Idiot driver placed ice cream over hot cookie so it was liquid by the time it got to us. Shouldn't have even delivered that desert.,59510
1,"Great decoration, the gold fishes in the huge tanks in the entry are really cool. The cool playing with his noodles is great animation. \nBUT when it comes to the food, it's not the same story maybe it was too \""Chinese food\"" for us. \nHubby took roasted duck, but there was not much meat but lots of bones to chew on. \nDaughter took a slightly spicy (they say) beef with hand pull noodles that burned her mouth. \nI was luck with the safe chicken and mushrooms and hand pull noodles. \n\nBasically, we will not come back never ever! \n\nTake pictures, but go eat somewhere else.",369398
2,"After hearing about this place from several people I wanted to try it myself!  The place had a few folks that were dining, no wait to sit.  It was around noon. I was torn between breakfast and lunch. I decided to get \""Chicken and Waffles\""  after a short wait my food arrived. I should add I did not get the pecans that were supposed to come on them.  Anywho I got the maple syrup that the waiter recommended. The waffle was light and fluffy with a nice crisp.  Nothing to write home about.  The chicken.. was extremely hard.  They were the chicken strips breaded. I honestly Felt like Chevy Chase in Christmas vacation eating that burnt turkey.  Three pieces came with it. ALL three pieces were way over cooked.  I had to say something to the waitress. Her response surprising. She said \""yea we get that a lot,  most people  soak it in maple syrup to soften it up\"" I'm like are you serious?  She continued \""it gets hard sitting under heat lamps,  when I have it I really gotta tear into it with a knife\"" hold up?  Its chicken strips a knife shouldn't be involved. I make fried chicken strips all the time and I NEVER have that problem. This place gets two stars from me based on the \""Leather\"" Chicken strips and the \""I know this and it sucks\"" tude about the chicken.",582469
3,"Real Foods, and Real Foods-esque shops are a bit like crack to me. They're totally addicting and I always end up buying things I shouldn't, or at least didn't intend to.\n\nSo, as a concept I really like Real Foods. It's just this location which gives me the case of the 3 stars, and that's in comparison to the Broughton St location.\n\nIt's *very* cramped, so much that whenever I paused to peruse the shelves I found I was in someone's way. I have found stocking to be a bit hit or miss as well, struggling to find exactly what I'm looking for when I know they carry it. \n\nOne of the beauties of a store like this is that you wander around and find new an unusual things to spend/waste your money on - the setup here doesn't encourage that at all. Good for my wallet I guess, but not so good for the business. \n\nMost recently I came in to buy gift certificates - these can be bought online but if you DO buy them online, you can only use them online. What?  What a strange and inconvenient system. Anyway, so I went to the store to buy them and they're actually kept in the back room somewhere so I had a reasonably extended wait while someone went to fetch these. An additional level of inconvenience. Staff were lovely while I waited, though, which certainly helps.",358028

I don't think you can find anyone better. Period.",579089
4,"This place was on the DD&D places my family wanted to go while in town, I joined them since I'd heard plenty about it but never gone.\n\nThe place is small, so yes there is going to be a wait.  You chose to eat there knowing this so complaining about the wait is pretty ridiculous.  That said, I'm not sure if I'd attempt coming here on a weekend, but during the workweek it was fine, the wait was maybe 20-30 minutes.\n\nThe food was great, the coffee was strong.  My only complaint is with more than one person checking on our table we asked for water from them 2-3 times and I don't think they ever came back with it.  Wasn't that big of a deal but seemed like it wasn't that hard since they were checking on us about every 2 minutes (got the feeling of being rushed through our meal, but maybe that is their way of keeping the flow of folks coming in and out).",193495
5,"I'm surprised to see this place with such a low rating. Today was my first experience at Gallo's and, after reading the reviews here, I'm hoping that experience was not a fluke. Our oldest two sons had a birthday party to attend. We decided to take our youngest out for an early dinner. We arrived shortly after 4 and the place had a few patrons but was not at all busy. We seated ourselves and someone attended to us right away. The service was outstanding; very friendly staff. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing. The food? Excellent! Salads came with our meals and were brought out first. They were nothing exciting, just simple salads but I usually don't expect much with a salad. As long as it isn't brown I'm happy. We ordered garlic bread and it was perfect; crispy but soft. The marinara sauce was delicous. We also ordered the stuffed hot peppers which were awesome. I had the baked ziti and my husband had the lasagna. Both were delicious. We both commented on the fact that Gallo's reminded us of our favorite Italian place in Japan, Angelo's. Yeah, I know...Italian food in Japan? It was great though. Our son ordered the kid's pizza and we tried that too. I prefer New York style thin crust and this has a thick crust. But it is a buttery, garlic crust that is worth eating just by itself. It was a wonderful experience and a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe are definitely going back.",147527
2,"This place is just \""ok\"" Yes, the punch card makes it pretty cheap. But, now I am regretting buying it. My son just doesn't play as long here as the other indoor places. I think because there is no \""toys\"" besides stuff to climb on.\n\n My biggest fault with this place is VIDEO GAMES. Why are they in a kids play place? The idea is to get the kids out of the house and active. My 2 yr old wants to just play games. I can stay at home and do that.\n\nMy advice,....get rid of the video games and put in some imaginative toys like maybe a play kitchen, doll house, tool bench, puzzles/book center etc.....\n\nAlso, all the snacks are JUNK except for maybe goldfish. But, the Plus is you can bring your own.",574338
4,Great Sesame bagel! It is a little sweeter and less hard than NYC bagels but they are great. Definitely eat them while they are hot because that is the best. I still think NY Bagels are the bomb :),330525
2,I was with citizens Bank of Massachusetts for 10 years. We  relocated to Squirrel hill and I thought that the service would be just as good. Unfortunately the service got worse. Extremely long lines at the squirrel Hill branch and managers that have their hands tied and can't do anything to help fix problems. Any issues you may have you have to call the 800 number and you have long hold times. I like a bank where I can go in and talk to somebody and I can get something done. I am not a fan of citizens Bank.,77732
2,"Went back second time...service so, so.  Order mixed drink tall,  came small... ordered chips with Guacamole...no Guacamole served...ordered plain chicken wings...no favor and not crisp like last time.  Definitely  need to work on consistency and more oversight by mgmt.  Not at the top of my list for a return visit.  One strike and you are out with me.",544146
1,"We came in for lunch with a $20 Yelp Deal.  The restaurant was located on W Sunset Rd/S Decatur Blvd in a gas station strip mall in Las Vegas.  There is a partition in front of the bathroom door.\n\nThe server gave us the dinner menus and he did not ask for our drink order..  The prices were really expensive.  My friend went up to the counter and asked if they had lunch menus.  There was one other couple having lunch.\n\nA female server took our order.  My friend ordered the Schweine Schnitzel and I ordered the Bockwurst.  Another couple walked in and sat behind us.\n\nThe female server came out of the kitchen and served  the couple behind us 25 minutes after we sat down.  They did not recognized what they had ordered.  The server went to the window at the kitchen and talk to the chef.  I heard her say she gave the food to the wrong table.  \n\nShe never came back to our table to appologize or offer us a free appetizer or beverage while we waited for our lunch.  How could she server the other couple our food!?\n\nThe male server brought us our food about 9 minutes later.  He did not say anything about the mix up either.\n\nThe Bockwurst was tasty.  The fried potatoes had pieces of crisp bacon.  The red cabbage was okay.\n\nThe Schweine Schnitzel was breaded.  There was no sauce or anything on it.  The  scoop of German potato salad was served cold.\n\nThe male server asked if we saved room for dessert.  My friend mentioned the mix up and asked for a free strudle.  He only offered us one.  \n\nThe Apple Strudle was served heated with a side of whipped cream and unsweeted cream in a dish.  It was the best part of the meal, but did not make up for the attitudes of the servers.",548091
3,"Despite their great croissants, I swore I'd never go back to Scratch after about my fifth or sixth run-in with their bratty staff (However, FWIW, the owners are quite nice). \n\nAfter almost two years I acquiesced to my desire and was pleased to find that the croissants are still the best I've had in the states and better than all but the very best I've had in France and Quebec.\n\nNo opinion on if the staff is any better. The service was totally underwhelming but not as openly hostile as they were in the past. Their croissants (especially pain au chocolat) are truly five-star and the rest of the food is generally good but I'm still quite wary of the staff.",306925
4,I was lucky enough to vist this Shushi bar on Sunday when they were not to busy. The Staff was very friendly and services was quick. Order two or three rolls and cumcumber salad it was enough to fill two people up. Prices are fair for Shushi.,302551

3,"So the Monte Carlo has recently been renovated. This hotel is a great moderately priced hotel and the renovations make it look a little nicer than it did before. \n\nThe hotel is pretty central strip. It's in between Aria and New York and right across from MGM. The hotel is pretty nice and the staff is good. We had no problems checking in or out. \n\nThere was one problem in that we had our do not disturb sign on the door all weekend but when we came back from a pool party on saturday we came into the room and one bed had been made. First, we had the do not disturb sign on because we didn't really need the room cleaned. Second, if someone was coming into the room to clean it, I would have locked my things up in my suitcase. This was a minor problem with us. because we didn't want our things being gone through which is why we had the sign up. But it appears that the sign was ignored. \n\nOther than that, it's a nice hotel. It's not the Bellagio but it's not Harrah's. It's a nice room that is in between the two in regards to luxury.",162906
1,"Why did I come here? I already know how mediocre this place is and I still came.  Wet Burrito was flavorless and the manager said \""its great\"" and basically said I was wrong.

3,"I go by this place almost every week. Tonight was my first time stepping inside.\n\nThe layout confused me at first, I wanted to walk straight ahead after entering the doors. Then my friend waived me over to the left side where the menu was on the wall. The counter where you order is near that.\n\nI like the simplicity of the menu. Either pick a burger that they've created or make up your own burger with different options/toppings. What I did not really like was that the server at the counter did not know what \""gluten-free\"" meant. He had a very \""wtf??\"" look on him. He went in the back to talk with the cook, then came back and brought out the employee handbook. We then flipped through it to find their allergen section. \n\nHere's what I can remember from the handbook:\n* Angus burgers are okay when ordered without the bun and without \""fried toppings\"" like the haystack onions\n* You might have issues with cross-contamination as everything is cooked on the same grill\n* Fries are not okay and there's obvious cross-contamination in the fryer\n* Premium and malt milkshakes are not okay (obvious reasons)\n\nWe were in a dangerous mood, so we stayed and ordered. My gluten-free friend ordered a Sin City burger, sans onions, sans bun. I got the \""Rebel Special\"" all-American burger, sans bun. I also added an egg on top.\n\nThe burgers came out on a plate. I was expecting it to be wrapped in lettuce, so it would be more burger-like, but it was like an open-faced sandwich -- or rather, a hamburger steak with toppings. We were given forks and knives to eat it with. Should have taken a pic, but we were starving.\n\nMy \""burger\"" was decent. It had cheese, pickles, raw red onions, and some ketchup/mustard. The egg went really well with the burger. My only gripe was that the burger meat itself was a tad over-seasoned. Not sure how my friend's burger was, but he scarfed it down quick.\n\nThe cost for all this was about $20 (including drinks and a regular shake). Worth it? I don't know. But it was nice to have a \""gourmet\"" burger for once.",490529
2,"Where to start.... I used to shop here a LOT and still do sometimes (due to it being so close to my home), but the place is well below the standards that every other Walmart seems to have. I have read Made in America (Sam Walton's autobiography), and he would roll over in his grave to see this location.\n\nI would like to note first and foremost that the Pharmacy always gives excellent, consistent quality service. \n\nWe have had two cars damaged just from simple oil changes here (I know, partially our fault for going back). One they stripped the threads on something requiring a trip a to an ACTUAL car repair shop (where we should have gone in the first place), the other they simply didn't put the oil cap back on and I realized it after about 20 miles of freeway driving when the engine gave me trouble, smelt like burnt oil and when I opened up the hood it was EVERYWHERE. They told me they reviewed the tape and their oil change guy (I hesitate to use the word mechanic) did nothing wrong. I was also told the manager would call me after talking to an assistant manager, however, this never happened. This bugs me more than anything else, even the damage to the vehicles. I don't know if it was a mistake on the assistant managers part or if the stores general manager just didn't want to talk to me, but it is absolutely inexcusable from any angle with a company that (usually) has as good of customer service as Walmart does.\n\nAlso, many things are consistently not stocked if you go in the evening. I know they only stock overnight, but I don't understand how they can so consistently not realize that certain items simply need more stock on the shelves. \n\nEmployees often smoke immediately outside the front doors close to closing time so  you can't avoid the smoke.\n\nDefinitely the second worst Wal-Mart I have ever patronized. \n\nOn the bright side, the frustration with this location has made me realize how much better, cleaner and competitively priced the Safeway down the street is!",102008
1,"We were give a gift certificate for this restaurant, and thought we would go for Valentines day. I made reservations a week before at the Sahara location, and called the day before to confirm. When we arrived, there were 4 other couples in the doorway waiting. We stood there for 10 minutes before someone came to the front. BTW, there is no podium or reception area at the front either) Did they greet us? NO. They took one couple to be seated. At that point, another young couple that was waiting, said to us, \""That's the 2nd couple that's been seated since we arrived half hour ago, and we were here before they were. We're appaled and would rather go elsewhere. Good luck to you.\"" We began to wonder if we should stay. We figured we would wait a while longer. After all, it was Valentines Day, where else are we going to get seated at the last minute?\nAbout 15 minutes went by, and no one came to greet us, and there were 2 empty tables. I walked across the room near the kitchen entrance and told one of the employees we had been waiting over 20 minutes, and no one has even aknowledged our presence, and that we had a reservation. Their response was, \"" sorry, it's Valentines Day and we're short staffed.\"" I informed them that was not my problem, and at the very least someone could at least greet us & inform us that they're running behind. Again, the response was, \""Sorry, we're too busy.\"" At that point we left as the other couple behind us did the same.\n\nA week later, we decided to return for my birthday(after all, we had a free gift certificate to use). If I had trusted my instincts the first time, I would've left the certificate on Valentines Day for someone else to use.\nAfter we again waited 10 minutes before someone aknowledged we were even there, we were seated., We were brought a wine list and asked for our drink order. We stated we would have water while we looked over the wine list. The server brought out tapwater with no ice, and a basket of very dry bread. Again, I started to question myself. (Should I go somewhere else?)\nThe salad was served on a warm plate with very runny dressing. My wife asked for her dressing on the side, and of course her salad was drenched instead.\nFor the main meal, my wife had an undercooked piece of fish, and I had overcooked gnocci.\nThis was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I made sure they were aware of that when I informed them they were not getting a tip. I would stay away from this place. The staff is rude, and they clearly do not care about the customer whatsoever. I'm glad I had a gift certificate, because I most certainly would not have paid for this experience.",316781
3,"We tried Finz on impulse.  It was pretty good!  We had the Cajun Shrimp Steam Pot which was huge, I am glad we shared it between two people because it was a lot of food, the shrimp are huuuuuge.  We also had a tuna appetizer that I am not sure if it was on special or on the menu, but it was really good.  The mac and cheese was a little chewy, not great.  We got to pick our seats, we tried outside but the amount of smokers out there was terrible.  They should make the restaurant non-smoking in this day and age.  It is a dive-like bar atmosphere though so perhaps that's why they allow smoking like that.  Our waitress was very kind and service was prompt.  Come casual, it looks fancier on the outside than it is on the inside.  The prices are a bit high for the experience.",343284
4,"Thanks to Kurt S. for putting me on to Cavi Hour at Red Square! I've always wanted to try this place, and my hubby and I visited twice on our most recent trip to Vegas. One of the highlights of the Vegas stay!\n\nOur first trip was a late night visit. To my supreme delight Red Square was having a reverse happy hour: 50% off of drinks from the cocktail list!  (I think this is available on weekdays from 11pm to 2am). I tried a few things on the drink menu including the \""Jewel of Russia,\"" a delicious refreshing fruit infused vodka. Fantastic! I'm thinking of trying to find this online so I can buy some for happy hour at home.\n\nOur second trip to Red Square was for Cavi Hour. Every day from 4-6 you can go buy two Imperia vodka drinks and with this you receive 1 oz of Petrossian caviar including the full spread of toast points, hard boiled eggs, chopped red onions, and creme fraiche. A beautiful delicious spread, and the best caviar I've ever had. (Granted I haven't had a whole lot, but I've had some and this was amazing).\n\nLoved it!",154610

2,"For the price, this place is seriously below par. \n\nI had a 40-minute sugar scrub/massage, for around $140. The treatment itself was fine, and the therapist was personable and efficient. The room was relaxing and pleasant, though the music was more elevator-style adult contemporary than traditional Zenlike spa music. Kinda lame.\n\nThe spa facilities are what really suck, though. If you want a massage, fine -- pay the $180 and get your treatment; then get the hell out. I can do a better spa day at my cheap-ass gym!!!\n\nThere is no reason to loiter here. The \""relaxation room\"" is bland, stocked with tea, apples and vapid Vegas magazines. The rest of the facility consists of a tiny locker room, teeny bathroom, and a steam room. That's it. If you want to soak in a whirlpool, you have to go OUT IN THE CASINO, down the hall, down the elevator, down another hall, and outdoors to the pool area. All this in your spa robe and slippers! And I visited in January -- WAY too cold to be walking outdoors in a wet robe!!\n\nI came with three girlfriends, and the place wasn't big enough for all of us. There are only two showers, and one was broken...so we had to take turns. The vanity area in the locker room was tiny, and one of the blow dryers was broken, so most of us just went up to our rooms to get ready. Keep this in mind if you're planning a spa day for your bridal party or something like that -- this place is only big enough to accommodate 2 guests at a time. Besides which, it sucks.\n\nIf I'm paying $140 for a massage, I want a fancy experience, dammit! Otherwise I'd just go to Massage Envy.",535914

4,"I have to say that I'm more of a gelato person, but this ice cream is awesome!  And it's even better that it's a locally-owned business.  \n\nThe shop itself is in a standard suburban strip mall, but inside the shop is clean and inviting, and the staff are friendly and attentive.  The ice cream comes in an assortment of flavors, from standards to some interesting unique ones, and from what I understand all of the dairy products used by the shop come from the owners' area farm.\n\nIn short, with ice cream like this, it's a wonder anyone within driving distance would ever go to Baskin Robbins or Coldstone.",371394

Lots of miles, lots of memories. Sure it is just an inanimate object. But this thing is so close to have been in all fifty states. Yes, ALL fifty (including Hawai'i). \n\nI digress. \n\nSo it is on on off-ramp of the 215. Disabled. I might or might not have checked in to CR-215 right before she broke down (a BIG fuck you to all the 'checking-in to beltways and parks and landmarks is pointless' crowd). \n\nAnyway, driver shows up. Gets the nifty ramp on his truck lowered and directs me to take the emergency brake off. Well, I do as told but must say that I do not keep my shift in gear. There are people that do and people who don't. I don't. What is the point? I always use the emergency brake. Fuck off, stop judging me. \n\nSo the car rolls. Fast. We are trying to stop it. Not working. Car suddenly stops. \n\nI get inside and pull the brake again. Driver, Cameron (?), points at his leg which is caught from the above the ankle down underneath my back tire. Car stopped suddenly because he used his foot like one uses a door stop, except on a car not a door and he used flesh and not rubbermaid\u00ae. \n\nFucking aye. \n\nCameron, or whatever his westernized name was, is Iraqi-American. We talked the whole way to the mechanic shop. Hardcore, albeit very kind and thoughtful, dude. \n\n777 Towing was just who USAA called up for my roadside assistance. They showed up well before the ETA and have at least one driver who will keep you entertained as you are driven to the shop. \n\n'Cameron' probably did not even have his foot checked out.

I thought to myself, \""Ok, but that's probably for someone with a relatively small appetite.\"" Because, you see, I usually eat \""American\"" proportions, so I ordered the Thai wrap with the Lentil Soup.\n\nIt's not that I was eating incredibly fast, but I didn't realize how freaking full I was until about 30 minutes after I was finished with lunch. I was actually uncomfortable from being so full. I would like to emphasize again that this really doesn't happen very often for me. The food was good, nothing crazy-awesome, but good. I just wish I would have eaten A LOT less of it. That wrap could have easily fed two people. If I go again, I'll be splitting the wrap!",473467

3,COMPED ROOM - MARDI GRAS TOWER\n\nLast month I comped 4 free nights at Bally's. The room at Bally's was spacious. There were two things I didn't like at Bally's. First the pool was closed due to the season. Second the bridge from Bally's to The Cromwell was closed. \n\nI was excited that I was able to comp 4 free nights at Harrah's. When I checked in Monday I was given a room at the Mardi Gras Tower. To my disbelief I was shocked how small the room was. This room looked like a closet that was expanded. The room was so cramped as it appeared the bed was squished between the wall and balcony. The worst part of the room was it was located on the Strip where music was playing at the Carnival Court. When I tried to go to sleep at night I had to use earplugs. I enjoyed the vuvuzela sound four years ago at World Cup in South Africa than the noise from the Strip at night.\n\nThe reasons I didn't give a smaller rating were that I comped a room and swam at the pool.,129059
4,"For LV this is a 4 star joint, as for the midwest, east coast, and south this is a 3 1/2 star. To become a 4 star elswhere I need a little more flavor and moist ribs. As a previous reviewer stated the pork ribs were a little dry. great beans, warning to light hearted these are spicy with a touch of jalapena, beef rib is moist tender and meaty. Ribs have just the right amount of mesq/hick smoke. Rib portions are proper, can stand alone w/o sauce, and well priced (avg $2.00 per bone). Not a fan of the potato salad to much mayo, not enough sugar and mustard. Bacon added to the potato salad is alright. If the ribs were taken off the grill 10mins earlier and just a little extra rub added before and after cooking, I would rate 5 stars LV and everwhere else. This place is a gem, lets see what happens.",538145

I love how you can see the Bellagio fountains from the patio-so perfect, and how they remember to keep you warm here with their patio heaters. :)\n\n  It loses a star because the food taste just \""average\"" to me.  I've been here twice.  Once I got an apple salad that left me still hungry (I think it's meant of more of an appetizer than an entree), the other time I got the Classique steak (my husband and I share the appetizers of the mac&cheese, and sweet potato soup), everything was \""just okay.\""  Big portions but ordinary tastes.  \n\nThe bread was amazing through, and bread is important to me!

5,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was extremely attentive, the room felt luxurious enough to warrant the price (we were in the Tower, an upgrade we made at checkin for a very sweet deal). I loved the bathrobes and flirted with the idea of buying one until I saw the tag in the hotel store (200 dollars, alas).\n\nThe more secluded pool you get when you upgrade was very nice and not crowded, with prompt service by the extremely helpful eyecandy, I mean staff.\n\nOur room deal included tickets to Le Reve, which was incredible. If you have a chance to see it I highly recommend you do. Much better than O in my opinion, but in a similar vein, combining dance and gymnastics and diving, with artistry in the visual effects that is mind blowing.\n\nWe also ate at their breakfast buffet, at 10:45 which it turns out is a good time to go- you can eat both the breakfast and lunch menus as they transition over. The bottomless margaritas were a good deal, since we definitely got into the spirit of the \""bottomless\"" part.  I was very impressed at the variety of dishes, and how good they were considering it was a buffet. I'm trying to remember what we had, but the names of specific dishes seem to have been drowned in the sea of OJ and bubbly.\n\nThe casino did NOT smell like cigarette smoke, which is always a plus for me. We only saw it as we passed through, as we weren't there to gamble.\n\nSave up your $$$ and give it a try.",132428

2,"Maybe it's the secluded location or perhaps the strange after taste of the broth left on your tongue.\n\nWhatever the case be, I really am not a fan of the place. The restaurant is pretty spacious with a karaoke stage to your left upon entering. There's a big \""fruit tree\"" located in the middle which is a nice sight. However, the wait time for food is rather long. I went here with a group of 7 and had to wait about 40 minutes for food? Nothing comparable to Pho Kim Long (my go to place for pho).  \n\nI'm pretty easily fulfilled with pho from any place, but I was just thrown off by the after taste of the broth as stated above. My final verdict? If you can get pho somewhere else - go for it.",285485
3,"Good food and service but wanted a nice dinner. in a restaurant where I feel like I'm eating with the people next to me we are so close, I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as we couldn't even hear our own conversation.

Seemed like undercooked beef fat,all gelatinous. heh heh,gross.\n-never got water refills and I was really thirsty...hubby got offered a soda refill in our last five minutes \n-no mac n cheese bar, french macaroons, mini candied/choc covered apples, or egg-cream-things that night\n\nHere's the pros,hope I don't miss any:\n+I love the individual pots of foods\n+there are automated wine stations, which I'm still not quite sure how to use, some kind of card was needed, which was never offered to me at any time...anyway, there are 8 bottles in there and you can get a full ($10), half($5), or quarter($2) pour of any of them\n+the water comes in big beautiful corked bottles and tastes really good\n+my fav foods: gnocchi with asiago cheese and lamb sauce!!!!, shrimp and grits, white clam pizza (I had 2), truffle potatoes gratin, mac n cheese, THE CHEESE PLATE, arugala salad, mango parfait, passion fruit fudge, fatass choc covered strawberries...so pretty much everything I grabbed was stellar\n+gorgeous scenery\n+Hubby put this at the top of his buffet list\n\nSo even after the given trouble the night before, this place did exceed my expectations. I would most certainly be back,as soon as possible, and I am now having a real hard time deciding who is my top buffet: Wicked spoon, Bellagio buffet, or buffet at M resort.

They have a large brick over to cook there pizza and the pizza comes out thin crust as if it was made in a bakers pride oven.

She did say she would try and I went to the restroom and came back out and she ..said..POSSIBLY we could sit at the bar...So we took it..a party of three...and we were happy to be there--it just sets the mood when the people that own the restaurant where YOU are going to spend YOUR MONEY and they act indifferent to you..\nWe started out with a bottle of BOOM BOOM Sirah..it was good. We ordered 3 appetizers...the Mediterranean Lamb, the Berkshire Pork Belly, and Butternut Squash  Soup.

3,"Overall: Come here for the crab legs, salad, shrimp cocktail, fried shrimp, the corn on the cob, free champagne and the tiramisu! Other than that, this buffet isn't anything special compared to the other ones. Wish they had better dessert selection (the ice cream are those machines from Souplantation, although they do have waffle cones). \n\nCompared to the other buffets, I feel like Bayside is on the lower end of the wow spectrum. I've eaten at Rio's buffet, Paris and the Spice Market, and I feel like all three of those were better than Bayside. The only reason we came here was because Mandalay Bay offered us $75 for us to spend on any of their dining facilities.  So for about $50 for four people, it was a pretty decent meal. \n\nThe price may be cheaper on regular days, but Vegas is really spicing things up and taking advantage of the Christmas season. No longer are the buffets only expensive on Christmas DAY, but they've taken the whole Christmas week and jacked up the prices by about $10 to $20 dollars! Because of this, there weren't that many people the night we ate here. Granted we arrived at around 5:30 for dinner, but we were seated fairly quickly. \n\nThey have different dining areas, but my mom wanted a table of its own rather than sitting at a booth connected to two other tables. We got a very nice table close to the salad bar with a very nice elderly waiter. Throughout the night I felt very sorry for just giving him all my plates of uneaten food or food I just wanted to try because he had so much to do and so many other people to serve. \n\nAnyway, there's the salad bar (with lots of different toppings - turkey, corn, mushroom, etc and a plethora of dressing), the Italian station, sushi/breakfast/shrimp cocktail, Asian food, an Italian pasta station, a prime rib/turkey/chicken station, crab legs, dessert and a champagne/beer bar section. \n\nThe champagne and beer are included in the fee you pay. I was so excited going up and asking for a champagne, and they didn't even card me! Anyway, the food selection is pretty good but the food itself isn't so great. The ribs were icky and cold, the prime rib tasted fake (just like at the Victorian Cafe!) and the pasta wasn't too tasty either. \n\nThe best things there were the shrimp cocktail, the salad, the fried shrimp, and the hot crab legs (make sure you get big ones as people tend to take those right away), the hot corn on the cob and the tiramisu! Loveeddd the tiramisu out of all the other desserts. I think I ate four or five of those in the little small cups. Left a tip for the waiter and left on a slightly happy (because of the tiramisu) slightly disappointed mood.",218512
3,"First dinner in Montreal and hotel concierge recommended.\n\nA very nice and elegant decor, a bit upscale but not too over the top.\n\nYou felt they honored great service.

I can admit that I had never been to Solo because I rarely ever drank coffee, let alone went to a coffee house to sit around while drinking it.  Times change I guess.  At any rate, enough of my rants.  We went to Solo Cafe six months ago for the first time and absolutely loved it.   Yes, FREE wi-fi, which is always a good idea if you're running a cafe, a easy going atmosphere, \""coffee-esque ambiance\"" with bookshelves, tables, books and games.  The latte is awesome and if you're a sucker for sweet drinks like I am, I do highly recommend the White Chocolate Mocha.  Friggin' awesome.  I'm a pastry (cherry) and mocha man now thanks to Solo.

3,"Got a great priceline price of $55 with a free breakfast (hot entree with oj and coffee)  and free shuttle from the airport til 10pm and a free happy hour with light snacks.\nNow the downside:\nThe place is old and run down, outside looks great with the 2 pools, and tennis courts but when you get in the rooms, they are old, musty and dated.  \nThere is a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and toaster oven inside the room.\nWhen I checked in late night, the staff wasn't very helpful, felt like I was bothering them.\nSince the place is so large and the doors open to the outside, doesn't feel as secure for a single female traveler.",108309
1,"I hadn't been to Las Vegas for 4 years so I took the first taxi from the airport. Yello-Checker-Star.   Big mistake!!!  He asked me which way I wanted to go to the Rio.  I said shortest, cheapest route.  He took the freeway.  The fare was $29.10 and when I gave him 2 $20's he asked if I wanted change!!  When I took a taxi from the Rio to the airport the next morning the fare was $16.20...  I will NEVER get in one of their cabs again and I am telling all of my friends (who fly a LOT) about my experience.  You may make more on the fare one time but it costs you in the end.

Although this is the chain version..its as close as I can get to having it in Vegas which is fine with me.  \n\nI was kinda disappointed the 1st time I went since there wasn't enough cheese on it for me and the crust was kinda medium rare.  The 2nd time was much better and tasted a lot closer to the real deal.  I STRONGLY advise ordering extra cheese and extra basil on it.  Otherwise the pizza seems a bit flimsy to me.",415537

Plus, they have a great discount program for frequent shoppers and they give you a 20% off coupon if you make a donation. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high. You really have to work the coupons along with the daily 50% off color items to get a good deal.",483396

4,"I went to dinner at Deseo with my friend while we were staying at my dads in Scottsdale. I am a huge fan of Latin cuisine so when I saw it was possible to get a three course meal for $39 I jumped at the chance.\n \nI chose the millionaire tacos as the entree which came with avocado and salsa and really enjoyed them. For the main I chose the eye fillet of beef and was pleasantly surprised at the size of beef served - it was great considering it was part of a three course meal. The beef was served with crab meat (not a fan), equadorian potato (delicious!), some peas and snow pea sprouts. Lastly the desert was just super delicious! I had a chocolate cigar and cappucino ice cream. \n\nMy friend and I sampled each others food and her entree and desert were really nice. Her main (chicken) was huge but wasn't as nice as her other courses. \n\nThe service was prompt and friendly, minus 1 star for the bland mojitos.",207071

4,"Very late review... For reasons to be a bit clearer in a moment. Definitely a hipster vibe as others have pointed out YET more inclusive than a crappy Chicago dive bar any day of the week.\n\nI visited during a trip I made on Labor Day weekend, just to cash in some miles and get away from the above mentioned city and its 1/3 of a summer we experienced this year. Seriously, felt like spring never ended, no Indian summer and straight into snow this week. I digress. I was genuinely concerned I'd run into the local Yelpers for whom I've had a long standing feud (although I noticed certain arch members have dropped off the face of online Yelp terra) yet I soldiered on. My concerns were lifted when I noticed a) how crowded it was. b) how young the crowd was and c) it was noticeably a hip hop night with DJ to boot. As inclusive as they pretend to be I'd never imagine to see the Yelp crowd that I knew at an \""urban\"" music setting. This proved to be the busiest venue that weekend as Phoenix was, as usual, an utter ghost town and historically so on both Memorial and Labor Day weekends - hence, the perfect weekend for a visit. I wanted to concentrate on visiting my favorite spots of old.\n\nSo, to summarize: SideBar is still open, and not taken over by some corporate chain. It's still open late nights. It hasn't lost its good atmosphere, even though it was too crowded for me that night. I am happy the Phx is retaining some culture without the CenPho idiots inserting themselves into everything nor making a pointless cause out of a new bar or restaurant constantly.",361303

3,"The Golden Dragon has an east to find location right off of Rose street and unlike other Cantonese places in the city they do not require reservations. The staff was friendly and the food was pretty good. It was not the most amazing Chinese food I have ever had but for stumbling upon it on a cold Saturday night, it was great. I will probably try a new place before coming back, but for a quick dinner give it a shot.",353823
4,"We went to the \""friends and family\"" opening of Maverick Rock Taco tonight and I must say, I can't wait to go back to try the regular menu.  Tonight, they had an assortment of chips and salsas and guacamole. In addition, they had shrimp skewers, chicken wings, sliders, and sausages.  I am not a huge fan of chicken wings, but theirs were really good.  I also loved the pineapple-mango salsa. Delish!  To go along with the light bites, they were serving up various Mexican beers and yummy white sangria. They also had a DJ spinning actual vinyl... too cool!",565881
3,"The experience of coming to Sandbar was decent but i don't think i would go again.  The service was the most disappointing aspect of it for me. To be fair they were very busy and I understand that but it was one disappointing aspect to the service tol many. To start off we didn't have menus for a good while after we got here. When our food did arrive finally i was left silverware-less for longer then I wanted to be when I was hungry from waiting for a good while earlier to even get my order in.  I had shredded beef enchiladas that were actually not bad. Not the best I've ever had but they were better than others as well with good black beans and rice as well.  \n\nMy friend had fish tacos, and this part of my review is hearsay admittedly, but he didn't like them too much. He could tell that they had used frozen mahi. If you have fish that's been frozen you're not going to have a good time. Truth. \n\nSo while I had food that was good enough my overall experience did not merit a return visit.",477312
4,"I visited this area for the first time in March 2014 with my family. We were just experiencing the city and not looking for anything specific. All of us loved it, young and old. We loved the little shops, especially Pittsburgh Popcorn Factory, Art of Steel, the European market, various street vendors and the biscotti shop. Even if you fasted, you wouldn't be able to try it all in one day. \n\nThere are tons of food options from snacks to sit down restaurants. If I was local I would have such a great time experiencing all of the local wonders and flavors as well as take advantage of the fresh produce market which had incredibly low prices. \n\nI wish they'd close off the roadways in peak hours. There isn't much room to move on the sidewalks but there is also traffic so it's a struggle to get around, especially with a stroller. I wish there was a little more variety in shops because I can see it getting old year after year if there isn't variation.",319691
3,"We go to Madison about once a month for various Badger sporting events. Sometimes we do double-headers and have to find somewhere to kill some time between the two events. \n\nLet me put in here that I was a little disappointed by Yelp Madison - the top 10 reviews are for bakeries and coffee houses, making it difficult to find what locals think is a great place to eat. \n\nAnyway, we ended up choosing the Old Fashioned a few days in advance, so I spent some time looking at the menu online and was really looking forward to trying some of their food. \n\nBecause of the timing of the events, we got there about 4:30. The place was still pretty busy considering it was pre-dinner time. It's a good thing we got there at that time, since it was absolutely stuffed to the gills by the time we left at 6. \n\nDespite having like 140 beers, they carry just one hard cider, which I think is a little ridiculous. But I ordered it. It wasn't very good. \n\nSo I perused the giant beer menu and went for an apple New Glarus I'd had elsewhere and loved. They were out of it. And before I could even go back to the menu, the waitress let me know they were out of 2 other fruit beers. However, the waitress suggested a beer on special that, based on the name, I'd never had tried, but it was quite good. So good on her for knowing the flavor profiles of what they had available. \n\nSince it was early, I was still pretty stuffed from lunch and the meals there all looked huge. I knew from Yelp that the fried cheese curds were a must and I couldn't imagine how I'd handle a whole meal, so I decided to piece on together. \n\nI ordered the curds for us to share, then ordered a side of the dill potato salad and a bowl of the beer cheese soup. \n\nThe curds were as advertised - spectacular. But everything else was a disappointment. \n\nThe beer cheese soup is clearly made with sharp cheddar - it had that good, sharp bite. But it was also incredibly gritty because hard cheese like that doesn't melt well. You could see the gritty pieces all over the spoon. It was just an unpleasant texture.\n\nAlso, because it was so sharp, it was kind of a lot - if you know what I mean. It needed some bread or a pretzel or .... something to break up the strong flavor. It came with a small packet of oyster crackers, but those just soaked up the soup and didn't accomplish anything. \n\nAnd the dill potato salad didn't taste anything like dill. It was ok, but not great, but I as someone who loves dill, I was really looking forward to it so the lack of flavor really disappointed me. \n\nSo I think the food was probably pretty ok, but after reading the menu I was really looking forward to these things and they failed to meet my expectations. \n\nThe boyfriend, incidentally, had the Saturday night Prime Rib special and it was delicious. He ordered the \""small\"" and the plate was huge, with a giant mound of onion strings, which I don't think he even touched, plus a baked potato and the Prime Rib. The Prime Rib was melt-in-your-mouth. \n\nI wish my meal had lived up to the promise of one bite of his. \n\nWe were in the room off to the left of the hostess station and there is a long bar there. As the restaurant got more and more crowded, so did the bar and there just wasn't room for all those people. Folks were bumping into the back of the BFs chair and the servers couldn't even get through.",179360
3,"Oh Lidia's!  How you've forsaken me!  \n\nI came here with a group of friends after having talked up the calamari entree.  Three out of five of us got it (the others had the osso buco and a pasta dish - the osso buco was good, and the pasta dish was a \""meh\"") and I just wanted to put my face behind my hands and whimper out of embarrassment.  The dish was totally watered down and not flavorful at all.  I did ask for it to be made a little less spicy, and I think their solution to that was to dilute the sauce.  But, another one of us had the entree at full strength, and it wasn't much better!\n\nI was questioned as to whether I would come back again, and I suppose I would answer yes to that, but only if someone else wanted to go.  After this experience, I don't think I can face the disappointment another time.",2923
4,"I've always liked stopping in at the Bottleshop. As for beer, their selection is hard to beat. And I have to say, I think the prices are pretty reasonable when you consider the selection carried.\n\nTheir food is pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. I would say it's a step above your average \""bar food\"" menu, but it definitely isn't gourmet either. But with that being said, you get a good meal for what you pay for. I've never really been disappointed, just don't go expecting to rave about the food. But I've never complained about it either!",357545
3,"They offer online ordering, which is a breeze to use. You might want to check your order before you leave though.

4,"I've been looking for a decent Chinese restaurant since moving to Charlotte 6 months ago and I think I've found it!!! Good food, quick service & polite people! \n\nI ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special not realizing it's spicy as it wasn't listed as such on the menu I saw, however, I brought this to their attention and the owner remade my order fresh without spice!! He was very polite and did not ask that I pay for what was ultimately a failure in communication. However, because of his service I will return!! \n\nThe food was fabulous and was made differently then I've seen before with mostly carrots & onions, but it was delicious!! I would strongly recommend this place for a quick authentic Chinese place!",84485
2,"We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average; your basic bar food, some with a Cajun flair.  From the grungy feel of the restaurant, I wouldn't want to experiment too much with food here, especially where seafood is concerned.  \n\nIf you're in college, like to party, and in your early to mid-twenties, Dixie's may seem like a cool hangout place.  If you're anything else, there are better options in Uptown.",6645
4,"The thing about the Cosmopolitan is that its so modern and hip and chic, its a little intimidating for those of us who only know about Kim Kardashian because ESPN tells us about the athlete she's banging and are not actively pursuing her kind of lifestyle.  However, I found it to be far more approachable than I expected it to be, especially during the day.\n\nThe people working there were very friendly, the restaurants are top notch, and the place is just flat out beautiful.  It doesn't hurt that the Cosmopolitan is a magnet for gorgeous women, the kind who think of Kim Kardashian as a role model, and hell I don't mind looking.",435740
1,"I am really disappointed in this place, but they are just around the corner and we keep hoping. HAHAHA! This time is the last! They just keep getting worse and worse. The selection is pathetic unless you get there immediately after they cook their donuts. Which appears to be once a day, some time in the morning. Otherwise, they're not fresh. To boot, they insist a bear claw is some kind of apple-filled monstrosity. In addition to the numerous times we have gotten what were supposed to be filled donuts and they had only a DOT of filling, the latest is donuts that they can't even bother cooking all the way. They tasted like wet dough  because they WERE WET DOUGH! These people are nice enough but they seem to not give a damn that the quality is TERRIBLE! Raise your standards, Arizona, a little, for crying out loud: Just because it's a fried carb does NOT mean you have to give it five stars.",472707

Better, in my opinion, than Memphis Championship BBQ but not as good as Lucille's.The food is consistently good and you get plenty of it for the money. 1/2 slab of ribs, corn, cornbread, and two sides for $12. You'll leave satisfied. All the other menu items I've tried in the past have been solid. On Monday's kids eat for $0.99 with the purchase of a regular entree.

5,"*This review is only in reference to the restaurant. My friend and I did not experience it as a club.*\n\nI absolutely love this place. If you're looking for a unique experience in Las Vegas, this would definitely be a place to have one. My friend and I love burlesque so if you're not so much into that, I don't know if you'd like it as much as we did.\n\nThe truffle mac & cheese is to die for. I've ordered that at a few other places and Cathouse, by far, had the best. The mushroom ravioli was a bit hard but it still tasted good. The dessert menu here is to die for. I have only eaten at an average percentage of Las Vegas restaurants but I'm pretty sure this is the only place where you'll be able to order red velvet cake and peppermint cotton candy.\n\nThe burlesque atmosphere manifests itself in almost every detail of the restaurant. The red patent leather doors, the black and white pictures on the walls, the waitresses' outfits, the interior of the restaurant, and best of all, the window. As someone who has no interest in nudity but loves to watch sexy girls dance, I really liked that every half hour or so, a very attractive girl would appear behind appear in a small room behind a large glass window. She would change behind a blanket, apply makeup to herself, read, etc.\n\nThe food is reasonably priced and tastes delicious.

3,"Frederico Fellini was a brillant and enigmatic Italian director of films in the 50's, 60's and 70's. 4 of his films won an Oscar for best foreign film.\nIf you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . \n\nHis movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. \n\nHe is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.\n\nThis Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. \n\nThe Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.\n\nService was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. \n\nInside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film. For something more like that, just step back out onto the Strip!",286905

I explained what had happened during Milo's grooming visit and she offered a blameless apology. I find it very comforting to find people that can apologize for a situation instead of passing the blame along to the next person, even when they were not at fault to begin with. She informed me that the person who groomed my dog on Saturday is no longer with the company and she asked if I would be willing to give The Dog Wash another chance. I was hesitant, but because of her sincere and helpful customer service I decided to give it one more shot. \nI won't give it a 5 star rating just yet, I still have to say what Milo's hair will look like, but it is a step in the right direction.",455664

1,"For those of you who only read partial reviews--this review is about Guitar Center as a COMPANY and not this individual location.  I admit that outright.\n\nI usually give 4s and 5s.  I'm one of those people who has positive things to say about just about anywhere...but not here.  Don't get me wrong--I have no problem with this individual location.  I have been trying to order something site-to-store from the parent company website for three days.  First, they advertised it as one price but as soon as it went into my cart it showed up as costing $100 more!  Because of our timeline, I ordered the item.  Well, Guitar Center must have a HUGE amount of fraud, because my credit card was instantly shut down (and I buy a lot of weird stuff, a lot of stuff online, spend money in different countries all the time, etc--this was NOT an expensive item, either)..  WOW!  So once I get that cleared up, I sent a screen shot of the original price--a price that I had confirmed via telephone with GC CS rep Preston.  They \""lost\"" my first screen shot.  I re-sent it, and uploaded it to a server to provide them with a URL...so this time they couldn't lose it.  All the while, EVERY agent asked me to call them on the phone to re-order.  I went through a friend's affiliate link after they told me about GC, giving them appropriate credit for the sale--so this unscrupulous company was actually trying to get out of giving credit under the terms of their OWN affiliate program!  So now they're claiming they have to cancel my order and I have to re-order via the phone, or they cannot honor their own coupon code.\n\nWell, the STORE might be just fine.  I don't know.  I didn't make it that far.  But I can tell you that the parent operation is questionable.  I'd rather give my business to a more ethical operation.  Sorry, GC Tempe...4 kids and who knows how many more musical instruments, and GuitarCenter.com lost you my business.",50628

2,"The only reason this place is getting 2stars is for the beer SELECTION, not the prices. And as all the other Yelpers, we so wanted to love this place, but just can't. My husband doesn't like it when he knows I'm going to give a bad review because he feels bad for them, BUT the whole point is to help these people figure it out! During our visit, we decided pretty quickly that we probably would not be coming back, so hopefully these reviews are taken seriously & with consideration. I will give the atmosphere and decor a 4 star, it's cute and has a nice set up with a lot of potential. And here comes the big but again, BUT you can't serve overpriced crappy food with great beer. You can't have a team that doesn't know anything about your great beer selection & brings you the wrong samplers. You can't have them correcting you multiple times on how to pronounce a beer if they get it wrong!! You can't have them give you the wrong tables check at the end of service. You can't have them wipe down a wet table while your seated with another wet, disgusting bar towel & then make you wait while they search for a dry one to finish the job. You just can't do any of those things & expect repeat customers. The food was bad, really bad! And when you are talking about the great beer, why would we come here if we could go right down the street to a Brewery who also has great food & beer that isn't overpriced! Let me say, we don't have a problem paying high prices for great beers or great food or great service, but when you miss on all counts, it felt like a waste of money. Perch you need to sit down with the greeters, chefs and the servers and have a pow wow, ASAP! Sorry for this BUT I just couldn't accept not writing this review. :(",621785
3,"As far as Target's go this one is pretty darn good. I mean, they sell the same everything and anything that every other Target does and the sales are just as good, but where they really shine is on Clearance items. For some reason they always seem to put the most fantastic stuff on clearance. Charcoal satin drapes. Plaid cloth flats. Three packs of Old Spice deoderant. Occasionally Choxie. Be sure to check out the Clearance sections in every department (or, you know, don't so I can snatch up all the finds).\n\nI am, however, pretty sure that the parking deck of this Target is the national headquarters for driving like an asshole.  It's like someone purposely filled the place with inept and rude drivers. The main level is usually packed anyway so i tend to park down a level and just take the stairs. Infinitely less infuriating.",293206
5,"Unlimited chips and salsa and buy one get one free Margaritas during Happy Hour: that's why we go.  The food isn't spectacular, but their signature dishes are innovative and good, although a little pricey.  There are certain menu items you can't get anywhere else.  \n\nTry the Panuchos (Pink Tacos) which is made with chicken.  \nYou have to order the Pink Taco Margarita on the rocks with salt.  The BEST!!  It's Jamaica based and you can't get it anywhere else.  \n\nUsually, we get too full on the drinks because it's buy one get one free and it has to be the same person, so expect to buy two drinks.  So we usually just get one plate and split.\n\nFor some odd reason, this Pink Taco is way better than the one in Hollywood.  And it's not because we're in Vegas and we're already having a good time, but the quality of the food and especially the drinks are better.  I know this because I've ordered the same drinks from this location and the one in Hollywood and Vegas wins!\n\nThe atmosphere here is fun and the patio is right by the pool.   This place is for lounging: eat, drink, converse and be merry without a sense of time.",172813
3,"I like this place but my budget can't make me an \""every-day-go-er\"", as I like to snack and work. I can't justify a $10+ breakfast (piece of cake and tea) all the time.

I was checking out the dog supplies and Howie got a new water and food bowl and a new toy and id tag and I got a key chain too:) OK there were other purchases made but when I was looking at the dog stuff I needed some help and it was so amazing how helpful everyone was. The girl who was helping me went to get me a basket and chatted for a few too, like it was no hassle. Then at check out it was so pleasant. When I got home it was so nice to see everything wrapped so nicely. Thanks for taking the time and effort!!!",251465
4,Amazing. It was some of the best food we had in Vegas. And the service was fantastic. I had been kind of disappointed with that while here but Ramsay's burgers definitely fits what you think when you discuss Vegas food and service.

4,"A really good branch of a fantastic Edinburgh coffee company.\n\nUnlike Starbuck's laboured \""cosmopolitan\"" style, this place really does feel cool. Inside is a wooden, natural aesthetic, with low level lighting that makes the place feel like some strange forest haven.\n\nI first visited Black Medicine when staying over at a friends. In the morning we came here for breakfast and I enjoyed a lovely croissant and cappacino. Since being back I've tried their smoothies several times and I have to agree with Gavin! I find this is a great place to spend a while, soaking up the atmosphere and reading the paper slowly while enjoying a pastry and a drink.\n\nA really great remedy (that is medicine...) to the stifling omni-present coffee shop chains.",358380
5,"I visited Jobing.com for the Kiss concert earlier this week. I previously visited a few years ago when the Dancing with the Stars tour came to town. The arena is very clean, I found parking to be a breeze and the staff great. Some coworkers told me to expect $20 for parking. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was no charge. My friend and I arrived early and had time to go to the Yardhouse close by. Having neighboring food and drink establishments close by helps save money on the inside. \n\nMy seats to the show were on the floor and ushers showed us the way. Although the tickets said no camera allowed, fans had cameras and cell phones. Security allowed people to walk to the stage with their camera, while the band members walked over and posed while playing. As long as fans stayed for only a couple of minutes and were orderly, security approved. The seats were good, the atmosphere great and it was maybe the best show I have ever seen.\n\nI found getting out of the arena was good. Police guided the way, directed traffic with a descent flow and it was a quick drive to the highway. Great night and an enjoyable venue!",116085
2,"Proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  But take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.\n\nThe rolls at Mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  The fish is also not every good quality.  Want to avoid the rice?  You can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  Don't.  It is the worst pieces of fish I've ever had.  Also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  Many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  Probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.\n\nHaving said all that, I really wasn't surprised.  What was I expecting when I was paying so little?  But what really got me down was the service.  The staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  I was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  We figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  We figured wrong.  They brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray.  With some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  We then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  The server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.  Thanks for listening to a simple request.\n\nOne thing that was pretty fun about Mido was the music and lights that play when there was a birthday.  Once I finally figured out what was going on, it was a lot of fun.  Way better than an annoying birthday song by the staff.",311669
1,"\""AY. F'ING. CARAMBA. How can a dealer get 21 so many times!!!\"" Those were my exact thoughts about 4 shoes into the $5 black jack table at O'Sheas. Right around the time when I was reevaluating why I ever stepped foot into this tiny, cramped, stuffy joint instead of seeking out a giant alcoholic beverage.\n\nI know this sounds riidiculous but I swear the black jack here is rigged! 4-5 shoes and NO ONE at the completely full table was hitting any ounce of a winning streak. The dealer was hitting black jack, 21, and 20 like nobody's business. I swear it's something with that automatic shuffling device they got goin' on there! I'm on to you O'Sheas!\n\nAfter losing about 2 years of my life in extra-stuffy second hand smoke, and one very crappy daquiri later, I decided enough was enough and left this place about 40 bucks in the hole. Yeah, not a big deal but this experience seriously sucked. I never missed my hotel's beautiful and well ventilated casino so much until I gambled here. UGH.

We were greeted from the door and seated immediately.\nWe started with couple of appetizers such as the infused game pate and grilled brie, and for main dish I ordered the steak with black pudding and my friend ordered the sauteed chicken in red pepper sauce.  Both of the dishes were well prepared. The steak and the black pudding just hit the spot. I also tried my friend's chicken and I loved that red pepper sauce.\nVeggies were a bit plain and maybe a little over cooked but the dinner was enjoyable and was fully completed with the great service we got from the woman working at the restaurant.

It can easily be shared by two folks.\n\n-I found that the meat dishes (duck, beef, and pork) outshined the seafood alternatives.

3,"Stayed here last week during my 4th trip to Las Vegas.   Harrah's sent me an offer for 2 nights comped and thus I decided to take them up on it since I have \""given\"" them plenty of money over the years at their various casinos around the country.  Hey, if it's for free it's for me.\n\nThis is not the nicest nor the worst hotel on the Strip; the rooms are clean and the location is great but it could use some updating.  The property in Lake Tahoe is nicer and I hear the AC flagship is their nicest under the Harrah's name but the LV branch was acceptable.   I don't think I would pay to stay here since there are so many more luxurious options in LV that you can find for a deal if you book ahead but I can't complain over a free room.  The casino was one of the busier ones at night (due to the location or perhaps due to the Carnival Court outdoor party that goes on all night and attracts frat boys galore) but it was not unbearably busy and the cocktail waitress did come around often.  Toby Keith's I Love this Bar & Grill and Kerry Simon's KGB are both good and prices were reasonable (separate reviews to follow for the restaurants). \n\nHarrah's can best be summed up as being a good place to stay for those on a budget that still have standards.  Cheaper rooms can be found (Imperial Palace, Circus Circus, Riviera) but I have heard horror stories regarding cleanliness.  The fact that they don't charge resort fees is a huge plus and the Total Rewards program is one of the better casino rewards programs around.",128909

3,"I've biked past Union Grill countless times as its $10 wine list sign blinks tauntingly but never stopped until recently.\n\nBesides the $10 wine list (yes, Union Grill has about 8+ different bottles of wine to choose from all for $10), Union Grill is known for its burgers. \n\nThese half-pound burgers are made from dry-aged ribeye, sirloin, brisket and chuck, which are then ground into a burger. Burgers are accompanied by lettuce, tomato, onions, and a dill pickle and served with your choice of cole slaw, waffle fries, sweet potato chips, vegetable of the day, or rosted garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nEven though the Five-hour Pot Roast was so very tempting, I went with the Blue UG. It came topped with imported English Stilton Blue Cheese and the accouterments. I choose waffle fries as my side and also the Homemade Steakburger Sauce.\n\nWhile I waited I entertained myself with some of that $10 wine. Always a good choice in my book. The burger came out a smidge more done than I asked (medium) but the quality made up for that. The flavor of the beef was exceptional. You can tell no pink goo was used in crafting this behemoth. This thing was thick and juicy (the bun suffered a bit) and as a result I committed one of my cardinal sins: I cut the burger in half. Gasp. I quickly got over it. The blue cheese was mild and creamy as it melted and the steakburger sauce (tasted like a richer, and spicier A1 sauce) really pulled the whole thing together. The waffle fries were tasty but didn't seem like they were made on-site.\n\nIt was throughly enjoyable and hit my burger craving spot oh so right.\n\nUnion Grill's menu has classic American favorites like Turkey Devonshire and Tuna Melts, and the atmosphere is friendly, inviting, and reminds you a 1980's game room (in a good way). These reasons plus more are why it was jam-packed with diners at 9 p.m. and will continue to be so for a long time to come. I'll be back... for that pot roast. You can count on that.",150356

I'd probably still stay on the strip if I was with my wife though, since there are no shows or fancy restaurants at the Red Rock.\n\nThat being said, I was really disappointed with the Feast Buffet.  It was about $22 which is not expensive, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the food.  I ate a little of everything, and nothing was particularly good.  Sushi was worse than what I can get at my local Ralphs.  The BBQ ribs were dry.  Hardly any fish to chose from.  Asian section was about as good as panda express.  Really, nothing great about it.  I was more excited about the Fat Burger that I got in the casino food court.  Come to think of it, I also got a great prosciutto sandwich in the casino too.  Next time, I will try the bbq place instead.  \n\nBTW, if you are staying at the Red Rock.  There's a great Whole Foods down the street that has a lot of prepared food.

We got asked about our meal when we were already done and had to ask twice for drink refills. He didn't seem friendly when we are a light hearted group.\nThe food was average. I got the tuna appetizer and it wasn't popping with flavor like ahi should be. The calamari the rest of the table got was like you can get anywhere, nothing special. For my main dish I got the crab stuffed shrimp, good not great. I like crab and shrimp so enjoyed but again the sauce and food wasn't popping with any flavor. The asparagus I could make at home. The sweet potato wedges were good but must have been a white sweet potato so not what I imagined and not sure I would have ordered. I don't tend to eat white potatoes. Lastly they brought cheesecake for the birthday, we aren't much into cheesecake but I'm told it was good. Now I love cobbler and have had some good ones based on my travels but their apple cobbler was bland to me.

I also ordered this chicken with broccoli and it was delicious.  They gave me so much broccoli I loved it.   \n\nAnyhowz I would definitely recommend this place to anybody.  Great chain restaurant if it is one.,34758
5,"This place is great.  We went on a Friday night.  The food was excellent, service was great.  Angela was our server and made sure we never lacked drinks and that our food came out at a great, comfortable pace.  Great live German music and an excellent outdoor seating area.\n\nAnd beer in 32oz steins.  Gotta love that!",214872
4,Cheapest place to buy your every day need for your home.\nGo there for a good customer service and great variety.\nI had forgotten my cc at home when realizing it at the register. \nShe wrapped all my groceries and placed them in the fridge until I came back with my cc.\nThanks.,548415
3,"Good food, huge portions (they're ok with sharing), and terrible coffee. I am immediately enamored when I order my potatoes crispy, and they show up that way! (The breakfast potatoes were the best part of the meal.)Nice place if you're wanting to sit and chat. The staff was extremely friendly.",352158
5,"This location is a bit far from where i live, but i'm in the area very often.  Tokyo Discount carries a variety of japanese products ranging from pencils and pens, cookware, to plushies and throw pillows of popular anime shows. I come here to browse their snacks and posters.\n\nmy last visit here i happened to spot an airsoft rifle on top of the fridge, i do love airsoft and if i see one randomly i jump for joy. Even though i wasn't buying it, the lady working there was so nice as to grab a stool, take down the heavy airsoft gun and even open it up for me to hold it. If i can recall correctly, the airsoft gun was an AGM MP40 , all metal construction, great weight and so on, but getting off topic on what this review is for!! LOL down to it, random airsoft gun in a cutesy asian store\n\nEverytime i walk in i like to take my time and browse the aisles even if i'm not into hello kitty or sailor moon, i still walk and take a look. The lady i see there often is very nice and she is so caring, overall i give a 5/5 for cleanliness, great customer service, and the prices are actually not tooo bad.",598421
2,"Food was good.  On weekend dinner they have all you can drink wine.  For bottomless wine it was decent, the only problem was that the server only refilled my glass once and I had to ask her to do it.  Service was just meh.\n\nBe warned: if you have the shrimp, you will have to pull off all the crap yourself.  \n\nAmbiance was just OK.  I would go to the Wynn or even the Bellagio before I'd return to this buffet.",392239
3,"I'm not a gourmet coffee fan.  For the most part I think gourmet tastes like dirt, or is way to strong.  With that said the coffee here was pretty good.  It was a bit annoying asking for a coffee and having to look at the board as to which one I wanted.  The house blend was nice though.  The place is cozy looking.  The staff was friendly.",2817
1,"Until the owners get the quality of the pizza back up to where it once was I decided to try one of their pasta dishes and ordered the lasagna last week. At $11.75 I expected better.\n\nAccording to the menu it's served with bread, butter, and salad. The lasagna itself was uneventful and dry with no where near enough sauce. Basically it appeared as unseasoned plain browned hamburger meat and some cheese wrapped like a burrito with the pasta, sauce, some more cheese, and baked in a foil bowl no where near long enough to even heat it thoroughly and melt the cheeses. \n\nThe bread appeared to be a sub roll, not toasted garlic bread like most Italian restaurants would serve. And they forgot the butter, which definitely would have helped get that dry bread down!\n\nThe salad consisted of a small container of prepackaged lettuce, shreaded cheese and black olives. And not the freshest I've encountered. And don't expect home made ranch dressing, again, prepackaged. Maybe I'll try another pasta dish in the future to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the spaghetti is better. \n\nSo this week I decided to try the hot wings. How hard can it be to screw up buffalo wings? Apparently it's pretty easy! The wing sauce was served on the side, which I liked, but whomever was manning the fryer left them in WAY too long and burnt them to a crisp! YUCK! I guess burnt chicken is better than raw chicken. And again, prepackaged ranch dressing. (Hint hint - Hidden Valley Ranch mix is available in a restaurant size. Just add butter milk and mayo and you're good to go!)\n\nI really wish these folks would get their quality control issues addressed. You can't cut corners in the restaurant business and expect to survive on your reputation alone. And that's the ONLY reason I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt.",328638
1,"I was in town for a national healthcare related conference hosted at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I had never been to Las Vegas before this, nor have I ever gambled. I flew in a day early and stayed at a Marriott in Henderson. I spent the next day hiking to the Hoover Dam and some nearby mountains.\n\nI had a rental car. For a first-timer, the Strip is a little daunting. After some maneuvering, I found Caesar's Palace. I didn't know they had free valet service and wouldn't you know it, the free parking garage is a loooong walk from the check-in desk. \n\nWhen I checked in I made a grave mistake that only someone who has never been to Vegas makes. I didn't tip the registration person before I checked in. This guaranteed me the worst room available at that time. I hadn't done enough homework on the nuances of Vegas. I would be paying for my initial error many times over again during my stay.\n\nI asked if there was a cart I could use to haul my week's worth of clothing and tradeshow materials to my room. I was curtly told that wasn't possible, but I could employ a staff member to do it for me. I declined. Even though it was going to be an ordeal to carry all of it through the floor of the casino, I could physically handle it. I was in the Roman Towers. It took three trips.\n\nAfter I checked in the room, I took a shower. The room itself was a nice size. I had a view of an interior courtyard rooftop. There was no door on the bathroom. There was a handset phone next to the toilet, more antiquated than quaint.\n\nA small TV screen was next to one of the sinks. The bath tub was large and in-charge. \n\nI went downstairs and signed up to get a player's club. I also signed in on FourSquare and was given a free buffet at Lagos as a special. \n\nI told them I had never gambled before and they took their time answering my questions. You can't buy chips with a credit card, but there are ATM machines all around that take plastic. You don't even need to know your pin number (you just pay a higher fee).\nI had set my limit at $100. When I withdrew it, I got a hundred dollar bill (instead of 20s). Next to the ATM is a machine which will turn your $100 bills into smaller denominations. \n\nI found a helpful young lady at the small concession stand near the parking lot elevator who gave me a map of the facility.\n\nI had dinner at the Noodle restaurant by the lobby elevator. The d\u00e9cor is a shocking white pattern with mirrors reflecting light into your eyeballs which still maybe adjusting from the dimness of the casino floor. They had massive fish tanks filled with thousands of goldfish.\n\nThe beer that says draft on the menu is not what we in America consider a draft. It was a weak beer in a bottle and draft was the brand. The noodle dish was okay, but average isn't what I want from Vegas dining, not at the price for my dinner.\n\nAll night I was roused through vigorous banging on the hotel wall at random times. Several thumps were hard enough to shake my bed. In the morning there was no cold water in the shower. Thankfully the bathtub had a hand-held shower extension and I could bathe there. That was the only morning that the shower's cold water didn't work.\n\nI discovered my room shared a wall with the servant's elevator and work room. That is what had made the noises the night before (and every night at random times during my entire stay).\n\nI ate each morning at Lagos and each time, it was excellent (except the last day). They have two lines. If you are a diamond or seven club member, there is no waiting. Otherwise, come at the wrong time, and the line looks like a crowd waiting for a Disney ride. I arrived early enough (8AM) each day that there was no line. Typically by the time I left, folks were accumulating, much more so on the weekend.\n\nThey had wonderful lox, capers and other delights. The waitstaff, almost to a fault, was exceedingly attentive. The only negative experience was when I asked to see if my friend had arrived before I did for our meal. I was told to look from the door but was discouraged from entering to see if he was indeed there.\n\nOn our last morning, the buffet had turned from being breakfast into being a 'brunch'. What that meant for us much greater cost and almost none of the good food we'd been enjoying all week. Lox were gone, and most of the regular breakfast items were either low or out. \n\nAnother friend of mine who arrived separately was incredulous that we didn't know the tip rule. He had the same level of room reserved as we did (same conference) and tipped the front desk $50 on check-in. He was given a palatial, presidential suite. \n\nYou can smoke in Vegas casinos. I don't mind second hand smoke, so it didn't bother me.\n\nThe TV doesn't get many channels other than Caesar/Las Vegas promos/Asian ones. The internet is woeful and expensive, but I didn't expect anything else. I brought my Sprint hotspot and was getting 4G almost everywhere.\n\nThe pool is nice, but randomly, private parties bar all but diamond/7 stars.",236454
4,"Ahhhhhhh....this was my first trip to Vegas that was not a blow-out girls trip. Instead, I tagged along with my poker-lovin' travelin' man (after assuring him I wouldn't cramp his table style), so I had a decent amount of time on my hands during the day. Cue spa day! \n\nI scheduled a 50 minute Ashiatsu massage because I can't seem to find anyone who does them in Atlanta and, if you really like deep tissue massage, there is truly nothing like it. The therapist massages you with his or her FEET! And no, they're not just walking on your back like my parents had me do when I was a kid, they are truly *massaging* you with those footsies, while holding on to bars bolted into the ceiling. I just can't describe it properly - it's freakin' amazing. \n\nI generally say \""no preference\"" when it comes to gender of the stranger who will be rubbin' away but had a mild moment of regret when my dude came to get me from the lounge - ewww boys' feet are YUCKY! Wow, I got over that real fast. This is going to come across wrong, but that man REALLY knew how to use his feet!\n\nThe massage was over before I knew it, as they do, but the noon poker tourney had just gotten started, so I took my time and took full advantage of every single amenity that spa had to offer. The women-only wet area is like most - hot jacuzzi, cold plunge pool, and a small \""warm\"" jacuzzi as well - as Goldilocks would say, it was juuuuust right. Eucalyptus steam room sweated Saturday night right out of me and the Redwood Sauna gave my skin a glow. Most ladies kept their swimsuits on, but a few free spirits went topless. The coed areas include the waiting lounge, a salt room, hot stone beds, and outdoor soaking pool overlooking the Liquid Lounge. Salt room was totally weird - Trekkie-esque lounge chairs and vibrating new age music. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting it to smell like the seaside, and instead it felt kind of cold and sterile, but stick around for a while - eventually you'll start to feel the effect of the salt cleaning out those sinuses. \n\nI'm not completely embarrassed to admit that my favorite part just might have been the sheer abundance of US Weekly and People magazines casually lying about in each room...oh yes, sometimes I just adore being a girl!",392901

2,"I'm a big fan of Barros so it sucks that i have to give this particular Barros such low marks. We went in and wow the place was just so asteticly unpleasing... The Barros in Maricopa is 10x more comfortable. \n\nThe quality of the pizza was sub par. All the pizzas were slightly burned and covered in grease. Lastly there were flies buzzing about. When my friend pointed it out to the waitress she seemed very smug as she asked him, \""what should we do about it?\"" Put up some fly paper, clean the place out. Very unprofessional. Big dissapointed compared to the other locations around the valley.",253484
3,"I've been to this place plenty of times before, & every time I've been here, I would definitely give 5 stars. I gave 3 stars because our server Scheila, was just completely horrible last night. I had an iced tea that didn't get offered to be refilled once. She kept refilling our waters but didn't ask at all if I wanted more iced tea. Of course I had to ask for it... I don't know if you pay by the glass for iced tea at this resturant but it would still be a little nice for her to ask. I don't think she even asked if we were doing ok the whole time we were sitting! The meat of course was beyond amazing. The lobster bisque is what I look forward to every time I'm headed here, if you haven't had it, you need to try it. It is one of the best soups I've ever had! Not exaggerating. We wanted more of the fried bananas and it felt like we had to hunt down our server for more. After all the food we had no idea where the waitress, so it was like an hour until we got our check. This is the first time we had a discount here, it was something like a buy one get one free coupon. Thank goodness we had that or else I would of been a little disappointed spending full price on the service we got. I'm thinking this whole bad service thing is because we were sitting in the corner, right next to her drink stand. But at the same time, you'd think she would come to the drink stand more often & see us. I'm not sure. I will definitely be back to this resturant because I love it so much, I will just remember not to ask for her.",347680
2,"The food was pretty tasty...and I highly suggest the ice cream tasting - a very unique and fun experience.  But the ambiance of the downstairs patio type area left a lot to be desired...

2,"6 of us went to Binks Midtown on friday night for a friend's birthday dinner. I would give the ambiance and food a 4 or 5 but the service was quite poor. My friend touched the bread serving dish and burned her hand so badly her fingers blistered. There was No warning about the temperature of the serving plate and there were  no apologies for her sizzling fingers either. She asked for ice to stop the pain and had to repeat the request 4 more times to 3 different people to get a simple ice-cube - which finally appeared about 15 minutes after she was burned.  \nThey knew ahead of time that it was a birthday for one of our group and there was not even a cupcake or a happy birthday wish from our server.\nAppetizers were brought out one at a time and out of sequence so  some of us were nearly done while others had yet to receive their starters.\nThe server seemed unaware of the use of \""please\"" or \""thank-you\""\nEvery request had to be made 3 or 4 times - everything was so slow it spoiled the experience. \nAs I said, the food was special but the service was so poor, I will not recommend it nor will I return.",599154
3,"I needed to get some new dish towels and I decided to check here.

The store is about the same as it was when it first opened and I was getting things for our house.\n\nAfter a quick look around the store, I left and got some nice towels elsewhere at a reasonable price.\n\nI've always found the employees to be quite pleasant.",147985
4,Very cool place to eat just outside of main Charlotte downtown area. I has the burnt ends and baked beans. Baked beans are AMAZING! 30 bucks for 2 people including an app. And you can smell it from the parking lot and shops nearby. My wife said the turkey sandwich is the best she ever had.,512257
5,"We bought an Amazon voucher for $99 that gave us 1/4 of a truck (supposedly a $247 value). We had a large pile of bricks, old cement blocks, tree limbs, bags of shingles, sticks, and other random yard refuse. We called and they quickly got us an appointment for the next day. They (Matt & Chris) showed up exactly on time and reviewed our pile and said they could take care of it for an additional $100 on top of our voucher. This was fine with us, as for $199 total cost they would do the hauling and loading of all that for us whereas our other only option was to get a dumpster for about $240 and do it ourselves. Anyhow, they were very friendly and got to work, constantly providing updates. Unfortunately, as they moved down the pile they ran into a bee nest, and one of them was allergic. However, they very kindly proceeded forward and just avoided the main bee area (note to others, inspect and SPRAY before these guys arrive). Anyhow, our load definitely took much more than 1/4 of the truck and they felt they had underestimated a little and didn't realize the number of bricks on the bottom of the pile, so we both agreed to up the final price to $150 additional on top of the voucher. So, this ended up being about the same cost to us, but we didn't do any of the work. Gave them each $10 for their help and hard work, and our yard is almost back to looking good (except the little pile still remaining for us to do Bee Battle with).\n\nOverall, these are good folks and provide you an estimate up front, so we were pleased.",566619

My only explanation for the lack of good service would be that it must be a cultural one. The staff is pretty professional - but i never saw one smile. And when i would ask for a substitution, it was met with much resistance. Then, when ordering desert, i was in a hurry and wanted my ice cream to go, they said they wouldn't - i was like \""put it in a dixie cup!\"" But i do have to say - the atmosphere is amazing and the food is great - i just think the entire staff needs to go through an american customer service training - ASAP!",369194
5,"I had to give this place 5 stars so this place could break even for the other review i read. The last review was probably written by an old man that was stuck in bed and glued to a TV instead of out enjoying the night life.\n\nWe were out there for a football game and this hotel situated us well within a 15min drive of the stadium as well as a few bar and grills. \n\nThis place was great. It provide all that was needed. Clean room, great customer service, breakfast. I must admit the breakfast wasn't the best but at least they try. The restroom sink was situated outside the restroom which was kind of odd but no biggy.  Conveniently located next to eateries within walking distance and a supermarket in a 5min drive. Our check in was easy and fast, parking was easy, and yes we had little noise with a occupants of the hotel being mostly football fans but it was no big deal. People out having fun.

When I arrived they were plenty of people pulling into the drive thru.  Since I couldn't figure out what to order, I went inside.  The staff was cordial.  I decided to keep it simple and ordered a traditional burrito.  I was so excited!  I got home and bit into it and \""crunch\""!  I tried again..more crunch!  Broken egg shells in my burrito!   Needless to say I lost my appetite.  I called to let them know I was bringing the burrito back and no I didn't want anything else (they offered).  Although they were very apologetic, I'm just not sure I can bring myself back to trying something else.  D'lish was a D'isappointment :(  Maybe I'll give the new Tempe location a try *sigh*.",240777
2,"It boggles my mind that MGM Grand can have such a rip off of a buffet and get away with it.  I guess having a giant casino and a lot of hungry clients walking out of Ka or just lots of gambling will do it.\n\nIt's not that the food is terrible; it's actually fairly decent, and there is a very large selection.  My concern here is why I'm spending $33 for corn dogs, fried chicken, and a do-it-yourself burrito section with dry beef and greasy beans.  You could get those items in a $10 lunch buffet these days.\n\nThat being said, it's not like they're completely devoid of decent food.  The day I went, there was a section where a chef will cut you a new york steak or a prime rib.  There was another section for king crab.  The issue here is that those items aren't anything special these days; The Mirage offers those as well for around $25.  Even worse is that the chefs were quite stingy with their meat, cutting me a small piece and telling me to come back later (presumably after stuffing myself with microwavable corn dog bites).\n\nIt seems to me that compared to more economical but quality buffets like the one at The Mirage, you're paying about $10 more for a larger selection at MGM Grand Buffet.  But the \""selection\"" we're talking about here is crap you could get from Hometown Buffet... hardly something I'd want to waste my time waiting in line for in Las Vegas.\n\nBottomline: If you're going to spend over thirty bucks for a buffet, go to the Bellagio or Wynn instead.  If you really must eat in MGM, go to one of their restaurants or even their food court with McDonald's.  Avoid the buffet.",204848
2,"We have been to the Silverton many times while visiting Vegas. We usally go to the  Twin Creek  restaraunt  but decided to try Mi Casa Grill Cantina.

At $18 a plate.\nOur other two entrees came with rice also ice cold. The waiter made a comment that we should have said something about  the rice right away. But he was not around to complain. They did keep our water glass full because the bus boy was doing his job.

3,"So here's the deal... if you want a motel quality room, in a prime location, and a cheap (for vegas) price... then this place may just work for you.\n\nHubby and I stayed here for our Couple's shower because we could get a suite for $100 a night. While the room wasn't anything special, it was decent. The whole room was huge, there were mirrors over the bed (classy!), and it had the craziest shower/bath I had ever scene! The whole thing was surrounded by mirrors and glass. When it got fogged over it was a bit like something out of some scary movie however. Oh, and you have to be 5ft tall or shorter if you want to take a shower. Unless you don't mind knelling in the tub. But, they kept the room clean and it was in a great location.\n\nRoom service was decent. However, I wouldn't waste money eating anywhere else in the hotel. Not a good food selection. The casino is well equipped with a variety of slot machines, which is nice for the slot machine junkies (like myself). The car show is worth seeing and pretty reasonably priced. Definitely something I would do again.\n\nI wouldn't recommend staying in the expansion on the back. A couple of my girlfriends stayed back there, and had to be escorted to their room by one of the guys every night. You know it's a bad location when you can smell the drugs walking through the halls and see a naked man running out of his room while arguing with his wife/girlfriend.\n\nOverall, an ok place if you are traveling on a budget. Just go elsewhere to eat and avoid the expansion!",166851
1,"Terrible service, i went here to only get a flat tire replaced. They said i needed new brakes so I said ok lets change them. I told the manager or the person helping me at the front desk that i was in a rush and wanted to order the brakes and come back. They basically had me sit in the waiting room for an hour before i came out to see what was going on. They spent an hour putting my rim on the WRONG size tire. When i told him that i needed to leave he said ok we will put your tires back on and let you leave. I reminded him i had a flat tire and was riding on a spare. The whole reason i came to them was to get one tire fixed and they made me wait an hour just to screw it all up. Worst care service i have ever gotten hands down",439357

1,"Is there a way to give negative stars?  We chose this place because it seemed like a nice quiet place to chill and talk.  At first, that's exactly what we got.  Our server was pleasant and quick with the drinks.  She left about 15 minutes after we sat down, however, and things turned awful.\n\nWe were harassed by 3 different homeless people for money.  Granted, it's not Fitzgerald's fault that homeless people come up to people sitting on their patio.

They care about themselves not being bothered and not the customers sitting on the patio.\n\nAround 1am we were told it was last call and asked by a bartender if we wanted another drink.  By 1:10 our tabs were all closed but we remained on the patio talking and finishing our last call drinks. As with all drinking, we took turns going into the bar to use the restroom.  At 1:30am we were told that we couldn't go in and out of the bar (even to use the restroom).  At 1:45 we were told by a bartender that the bar closes at 1:30 and the sign in the window and google (which both say the bar closes at 2am) haven't been right \""for a long time.\"" The entire time this was going on, the bartenders were sitting inside at the bar with a \""friend\"" watching us.

The staff here do not care about this place or the perception their actions leave with the customers.  I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out $100 bills with every beer (which was only slightly above room temperature btw).

If you are lucky on game day to find a lot with vacancies, otherwise go online and reserve a spot for $15.00.  Some lots guarantee security and restrooms and an attendant all day.  Now the stadium adheres to all of the newest NFL guidelines pertaining to what you can bring into the stadium.  Ladies were turned away because they had larger than regulation purses.  Those of you with seat cushions read the guidelines.  Diaper bags, another no no.  Parents were instructed to return to their vehicle and only bring what was necessary.  Food concessions was a big disappointment.  Bogangles were all over the place.  Other sports complexes over a superior variety, and your choices were limited here.  Was disappointed, since the web site had limited ticket availability, and yet there were way to many empty seats.  Before and after the game the city police are controlling traffic.  Everything is orderly.  Did not see to many venders parading up and down the sections.  Apparently, the stadium wants you to leave your seat.  Which may explain the enormous amount of flat screen TV's broadcasting the game on the concourse.",6473

People here won't do a job! ....rush rush rush to get to the next fool to pay them 25 bucks for a pedicure. They didn't take the cuticles cleaned up, soaked my feet and put the polish on my toes which was smeared all over. It looked like a 2 year old putting lipstick for fun. Omg! Awful, the guy and the chick here had major attitude. They try to fix wrong with another wrong... The heck bro! So I had to stop it. No Polish walked out.. Still paid them 25 bucks they might need it to go back to school to be a nail tech or manicurist. Ouch! Bam!",59895
2,"We're staying at Ceasar's palace and decided to walk over to try the breakfast due to all the good reviews, big mistake.\n\nWhen you walk into the shoppes at the Venetian, you will be stopped by tour salespeople every 5 mins trying to sell you something.  It's like when you exit the airport in Cancun or Cabo and you're bumrushed by timeshare sharks.  Then you have to walkthru their rooms on the 4th floor to the spa, that's where the cafe is, in the spa.\n\nAs if that's not ingenious itself, there's no wait service.  You order at the counter and wait for the food to be brought over.  They're understaffed, I even over heard them say so, so expect to wait to put your order in and wait some more for the overpriced food.  Oh yea, we ordered 2 breakfast sandwitches and 2 coffees for $40.\n\nThe portion is tiny, don't expect to get full but you can expect the feeling of being ripped off, bigtime...  We saw 3 ppl sit down and walked right out.  We should have followed.\n\nI would recommend this place only for those staying in the hotel, want something extra light and don't mind spending alot of money.",174422

1,I've come here often and always had good food and service. Except for today. My order was wrong. No big deal I walk up they offer to fix it I say ok. 15 minutes later no food. I walk up again and the guy asked if I had received my food. I said no so he went and had them make it again. They did. I get back to my table and the food is wrong again. Then when I walk back up the girl tells me I asked for different hotdogs. I asked for what I ordered and what was on my receipt. No one apologized. I got frustrated and walked to the cashier and asked for my money back. I said I'd pay for the burger and fries my girlfriend ate but not the hotdogs. \n\nWhat made me mad was no manager took responsibility or tried to make it right. All I got was grief from the employees for their mistakes. Sad to say but I'll never go back.,590913
5,"Love the food here. As of now this is my favorite chef in town. Great use of flavors and local cuisine. Not super pricey and a lot of bang for your buck. I eat red meat, but I'm a red meat snob. I won't eat a pub burger out anywhere but here. The duck fat fries are amazing. If you are afraid of gravies ask for it on the side.I recommend everything on the menu. If you would eat it somewhere else, try it here. The food is like something you would dream came from a french countryside home, butchered out back and cooked in a big old black iron skillet. I just ate, but know I'm hungry again. ;)",409137

3,"3.5 Stars\n\nWhen I am building the perfect salad bar buffet in my mind, Sweet Tomatoes comes pretty close.  I understand that this is a chain and can not expect them to cater to my likes 100%.  As you walk in they have a few pre-made salads and in my made up place they would make your salad with the items you like and mix it along with your dressing selection in a bowl for you.  They have enough toppings to make your salad and a good variety of salad dressings.  They offer hot pasta items, muffins, bread, focaccia bread, soups, fruits and frozen yogurt.  I may have missed a few items but am painting a decent enough picture for the folks who never been to a Sweet Tomatoes.  I would like to see smaller batches of ingredients out on the salad bar with more frequent replenishment to ensure the freshest items are out all the time, again this is a item I would do in my made up salad bar.  The price is a bit high as well but usually are able to find coupons online to offset the cost a bit.",17806

5,"Words cannot describe this show. Garth is amazing. His last tour ended in 1998 and since then he has stayed at home in Oklahoma raising his children. When his tour ended I was a little too young to be going to concerts. \nI had always said that there were only two reasons I'd ever go to Las Vegas. One was to see David Copperfield and the second was to see Garth Brooks if he ever came. Well, I saw David a couple years ago when he came to San Jose and last October I learned that Garth would be playing at Wynn. \nThe tickets are VERY hard to get. The first series of dates sold out in 5 hours. I was, unfortunately, not one of the lucky ones that got tickets that day. I did manage to get tickets earlier this month and planned the trip around my mom's birthday. \nIt was just Garth and his guitar up on stage. In this particular show that I went to he started out talking about what influenced him growing up and who his father and brothers were listening to. He started taking requests and even brought out his wife- Trisha Yearwood- to sing a couple songs! \nHe is a very amazing and talented artist and that showed on stage once again.",426712
4,"I almost forgot this was the place that had those flavor flav wings lol. so when I came in and ordered my calzone for around $7 i was expecting something way below standard. come on they had flavor flavs wings he's one funky character and a cheesy sign for 99 cent wings i wrote them off before trying them. \n\nIt's probably been a while since they had that sign and the experiment with flavor flavs wings so I gave them a shot. Located in the same center as Bachi Burger but way on the other side. Its a pretty small, clean pizzeria, holds about 10 people maybe more, with a flat screen and some happy pics of who is probably Mama Cimino on one wall and a mural on another wall. \n\nMy sausage calzone was larger then any other I've had a nice size and hot right out of the oven. Enough for tomorrow's lunch or tonight's snack. Came with some marinara sauce on the side, which was a little watery so just mixed in some parmesan and it was fine for me, some made from scratch ranch dressing not the processed stuff. I would have taken a pic but I was starving and already ate some of it. Order in advance because it took at least 20 mins. \n\nThey make Chicago style deep dish pizza, which is my favorite type of pizza so I'll probably come back for that, and the NY style pizza, their largest was huge I forget the measurements but it was only around $17. they have a good menu, calzones, strombolis, sandwiches, pizzas, wings, and at some decent prices. i think they also have some 5 and 10 foot long sandwiches. get back to you on that. \n\nSome of their by slice pizzas during lunch were old and dried up. so hopefully you catch it when it's fresh and right out of the oven.\n\nIf you like them on facebook you get 15% off.",384537

4,Worth it just for the view.\n\nWe only went up to visit the lounge. One big downside was the cover charge ($20 each!) that we weren't expecting but we just treated it as an entry fee as if going to a viewing deck ;)\n\nThe drinks were nice and the bar was starting to get a bit busier as we got there.

4,"Note: I only give out 5 stars to restaurants that are EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.\n\nOh, how I truly wish I could give Stick E Rice 5 stars! If I could grant this place 4.5 stars, I would quickly and happily do so. I spent the last few minutes debating this review with my wife, who is absolutely convinced that Stick E Rice deserves 5 stars.\n\nThis restaurant has several strong points. Their service is truly amazing. Every time I have come here, I have had the pleasure of being served by the same waitress, whose friendly greetings and smiles make me feel like a member of her family. The waitstaff is always on point, from timing courses well to clearing used dishes promptly. Drink refills are typically not an issue, unless you're only drinking water (but they never leave you wanting for a refill). The reason for this is that soft drinks are served ice cold in cans, accompanied by cold glasses filled with ice. I know that restaurants typically may profit more from serving soft drinks in cans, but I feel that better establishments provide fountain drinks with free refills.\n\nI ordered the potstickers as an appetizer, and they are VERY tasty and lack the excessive \""doughiness\"" served by so many other restaurants. I don't know if they're homemade, but I can tell you that surely you can't go wrong in placing an order for them.\n\nI typically order from the lunch special menu, so my meal is accompanied by a complimentary soup. The egg drop soup is tasty, and served in an attractive cup with a side of crispy chow mein \""chips.\"" I once had a rendition of the hot and sour soup, and I honestly have to say that it needs much work to resemble a true Chinese hot and sour soup.\n\nThe main courses are always flavorful. The portions may seem small, but upon finishing my order I am always very satisfied. The pepper steak, orange chicken, pad thai and mixed vegetable options are wonderful entrees. My wife's regular favorite entree is the \""mixed vegetables with added shrimp.\""\n\nYou simply must leave room for dessert!  Stick E Rice offers a dessert called \""Stick E Mango\"" that is absolutely a must-have! We order it every time we come here. Every time. The sticky rice is formed in sushi-sized pieces, and bear the almost banana-like sweetened flavor of coconut. Each order is seemingly bombarded with sliced mango! The mango has always been sweet and succulent; I have never had the unpleasantness of biting into a more green or hardened slice of mango. The mango is drizzled with a sweetened coconut \""caramel.\""\n\nI absolutely cannot fathom why anyone could possibly review Stick E Rice with less than a 3-star rating! Sure, the menu may not be perfectly Thai; this restaurant has more of a Thai-Chinese fusion offering, but this combination serves to offer its clientele more choices and even a more familiar option for the less brave. The menu is also somewhat customizable to personal taste and spiciness preference.\n\nTo maybe receive a 5-star rating:\n1. Serve fountain drinks with free refills. Even if free refills are not offered, at least, do not serve the soft drinks in cans! That's what I would expect at a home BBQ, not at a nicer restaurant. At a minimum, to preserve the appearance of \""freshness,\"" the soft drinks could be served in unopened, chilled glass bottles. I still prefer and strongly recommend the fountain drink option for cost effectiveness and \""friendliness\"" when serving very spicy food that may need to be frequently washed down.\n2. The restroom is very clean and spacious, but one must pass the register area and the doorway to the kitchen in order to access the restroom. I understand that this is a small business, but the area near the register should be kept clutter-free. I saw stacks of various papers, mail and other things which gave the appearance of an \""amateur\"" business. Clean that area up, especially if it's visible to clients. The kitchen is quite clean from what I could see. Then again, I shouldn't be able to see into the kitchen. Due to design limitations, a door is an unsafe option, but perhaps a sheer curtain or something may be put up to obscure the customer's view into the cooking area, and to somewhat muffle the noise coming from the kitchen into the dining area. I don't know what options are available, but that's not my job, is it?\n3. Move the music system to the back counter, out of sight.  At a minimum, hide the speaker wires or install some recessed or wireless speakers.\n4. Refine the menu more (i.e. hot and sour soup).",465375

The staff could not be better, everyone who works here is friendly and efficient and really helped us with our business and personal needs. The free breakfast is the best I have ever had at a hotel and the 24-hour menu is nice and not overly expensive. The Internet connection was fast and reliable. I could not have been more pleased.",418812
5,"I  love this place. This is like a mini version of a Fresh and Easy Market Filipino style. It's a lifesaver if you realize you're out of something like a can of coconut milk or some dried fish or sweet rice flour which is one item I bought today.  Before you drive a half hour or so to Seafood City, come here instead. There is a little of everything you need to make your favorite Filipino dish.  My mom lives 2 miles away, and always sends me or my brother here to get this and that. For North Vegas residents, it's a stress free and rather fun drive.\n\nThis is a family run business, and the service is great.  Unless they're super busy I always ask where the item is that I need.  They'll walk you right over to it, and you can then spend all the time you need to decide which brand to buy.  Of course, I end up asking \""Which of these two are more popular\""  And they give their honest opinion.\n\nI like that in season, they have some fresh produce. They have some freshly roasted peanuts which were $1.90 a pound.  We actually boil them for a nice snack. Almost always they have cooking bananas, sometimes they have papayas, fresh coconut, oranges, melons, etc. My mom often sends us here to get various noodles for pancit, along with lumpia, perhaps the most popular Filipino dishes. The dish that most of our friends love the most is dinuguan, roughly translated, \""made from  pork blood\"".  When you add coconut milk lean pork, vinegar, salt, and sometimes innards like intestines, spices like bay leaf and black pepper, garlic, onion, etc...the flavor is quite unique, mild slightly sweet. My doc says this is a great dish if you have iron poor blood. \n\nAt the front counter are desserts made by Valerio's bakery. I find myself always buying something sweet.  This trip for $10 I bought a taro and sweet rice tootsie roll shaped dessert coated with coconut called Puto Bong Bong.  They also had a multi layer, multi colored sweet rice cake called Sapin Sapin. There were lots more, but everything in moderation  \n\nWe've been customers since 2007 and will continue to be as long as they're around.",616068
5,"It would get 4 stars for the name alone.  The idea that they would just sell you hot dogs and six-packs is so just and pure it almost makes me want to weep.  \n\nI went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog and one with relish, kraut, and brown mustard.  Both were excellent dogs, and their beer list is incredible.  \n\nAgain, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes off as real?  If they tried this in NYC or Boston, it would come off as a gimmick.  Whereas here, in Swissvale, it just seems like a neighborhood place with a twist.  A coronary twist.  So good.....",1562
5,"Fabulous show, really glad we went.  The whole thing was entertaining from start to finish.  The cast all did very well and looked and sounded just like the real Rat Pack.

4,"There are actually things grown in the Las Vegas area available at this market, but you have to know where to look!  The California stuff is nice (citrus, strawberries and Central Valley supplements), but thanks to Gilcrease, Herbs by Diane from Boulder City and another vendor or two there is the option to buy from actual local sources.  This certainly beats any of the other Fresh 52 markets in terms of vendors and variety.\n\nThe parking was tight and I had to stalk someone for a spot.  Also, the indoor vendors are a little oddly place...why?  Not a bad idea, just unusual and strangely formatted.  Certainly a nice option for adverse weather, but that indoor venue also got crowded and congested as any setting with lots of lingering folks.\n\nI was pleased to come away with things I could never find in a commercial grocery superstore including corn shoots, a massive and beautifully misshapen romanesco cauliflower, tender and huge stalks of purple asparagus and a variety of luscious citrus without stickers attached.",512403

Won't be going back here.",146819

I stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled NO! And just think, this is JUST the potato salad from here! \n\nThe burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever! I stick with the cheeseburger because I want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it. I literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side. Ok, I know that sounds dirty...but it was SO good!! I haven't strayed much from the burgers, but I did have the tuna melt once and it was good, but nothing compares to the burgers. I mean, that's what you go there for! Plus, my friend saw Russell Crowe there while he was filming a movie in the burgh, so you have to know it's good if his peeps recommended he go there!",3507

The ribs were a tad dry.  \n- Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9 with orange cr\u00e8me anglaise and orange-cardamom ice cream.  Wow, this was one amazing dessert.  It was delicious down to the last drop.  Had me licking my spoon.\n\nService was excellent.  We were talking about the wine cellar with our waiter and he even took us on a tour of the cellar after our meal.

4,"I am far from expert in this field of  sushi but I've tried a fair amount at a fair number of places, and I thought this was exceptional. I already liked the Korean food at the predecessor C J B Korean establishment and now I have a new favorite place for sushi as well.  \n\nBlack suspended tile ceilings with dark concrete floors, walls of bright green and some modern oriental art in between. Slightly spare, clean, modern feel to the place.  Men's room was spotlessly clean, modern with up to date fixtures, stocked with all the necessities. \n\nOur young server was friendly and attentive and our water glasses never went dry - except when I bumblingly knocked mine over, which was taken in stride by staff, and quickly replaced with a fresh glass. Service, from being seated, to order taking, to delivery food, to delivery of the check, involved no undue delays.  In fact, as Norm R noted,  service was almost too efficient as servers were anxious to whisk away our plates almost before we cleared them, but I'll take that over that experienced by another reviewer any day.\n\nNow as to the FOOD, Excellent in every way.  Beautifully presented, multiple distinct flavors. Best shumai ever tasted. Tongue tantalizing tuna tataki, rich, red, flavorful, and our accidental order, the \""OhYa I Forgot\"", was a definite \""no regrets\"", the closest thing to a dessert sushi I've ever encountered with its touch of peach.  \n\nAnd finally, we didn't go away hungry, indeed as one should not from a $65 + tip meal for two, but you need not spend nearly so much.  There are considerably reduced happy hour prices and several \""chef's surprise\"" samplers at under $20. \n\nThe service we received was \""comfortable\"", perhaps more friendly than polished, and that's just fine by me.  I highly recommend with the hope the service you receive is as good as we got, and not the indifference experienced by another recent reviewer below.",234123

4,"This is the first time I had Japanese hot pot and I am hooked. Usually hot pot places aren't too thrilling or the greatest thing in the world to me, but after coming here it is life changing (or at least opinion changing). \n\nGuess what they had on their menu that caught my eyes... a mushroom party plate!! I cannot stress enough on how much I love mushrooms. I LOVE IT!! *does a little dance* This plate has 6 or 7 different types of mushrooms and a second plate full of vegetables with noodles. You can either eat your main course with rice or ramen soup style. \n\nWhen I come back to Vegas, this is definitely one of the places I would revisit.",223948

The food just isn't very good and if it is memorable in any way it is because it isn't good.\n\nWe ended up here today because a friend wanted to meet up for drinks.  The bar was clean and our server, even though she was new, did well taking care of us.  Everyone at the table had either tap or bottled beer, except me, and had no complaints.\n\nI had a 65th anniversary special margarita.  It was big and refreshing... It also cost $10!  Was it worth ten bucks? No! But it was far better than the $7 margarita made with crappy booze... But I only had one as I find the cost highly prohibitive.\n\nThe table shared a plate of deep fried green chili strips off the Chili Harvest menu and they were quite good.  I don't like that they were fried... I think of frying as something one does when they don't have the skills to appropriately showcase the flavor of the item... But they were still good!\n\nThe biggest complaint at the table was the fact that there was no tangible happy hour offering... They once had a happy hour food spread, but not today... They had half price appetizers off the regular menu (the seasonal menu was not included)... But no buffet... Why?  \n\nDrinks and a happy hour buffet are why we were there, now there is little reason to return...",251681
4,"Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.\n\nWe go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.\n\nOur first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.\n\nShortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the \""heavy\"" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!\n\nStrip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor.",257611

5,This is the best Hotel resort without a casino in Vegas. The Hotel is very new about a year old when we visited and very modern. The staff was very polite and helpful. There is not smoking in the hotel and also not casino so the hotel has a very relaxed  atmosphere. Their is a free 24hr rail service to take you to the strip within a few min when you are ready for Vegas. The spa was very nice (but pricy) my wife and I enjoyed our couples massages. The pool area is very relaxing and not overcrowded like some of the hotels on the strip.  I will be returning. \n(FYI this is a time share style resort so they charge a resort fee per night if you are not an owner),375867

3,"This was the first time I have been able to attend the Brazilian Festival and I have been wanting to come now for a long time. So glad I came because I will not be returning next year.\n\nThe location is great, there's lots of space and parking available. They have the stage set up in the middle where they give great performances and have plenty of room where you are able to dance along with them if you want. They also have plenty of retail vendors and of course a small somewhat decent play area for the kids. \n\nThe food however, well I am very disappointed in that. Not enough food vendors, I believe there was only about 8-10 vendors. The Only vendor I recognized was Texas de Brazil, I did order their 3 meat sampler for $7, which of course was juicy and tender as I know their food is delicious. As for everything else, well, not impressed. I also ordered my Caipirinha for $6, which was ok. \n\nAll I'm saying is that for being a Brazilian Festival they should really have more food. The entertainment is good, the kid area can definitely improve. My suggestion, get your tickets through Groupon as you get a great value to attend and it won't feel like a waste of money when you too feel disappointed.",591841
2,"The food was good but OVERPRICED.  The setup was exactly like the old spot.  I thought the old location forced them into a cramped space but apparently,  they like it that way.  Service was good.  The $12 specialty margaritas DID NOT produce a buzz and I COULD NOT taste the tequila. Yes, I SAID IT, 12 DOLLARS!!  (Pint size with ice)  I guess if i order a $12 drink, I expect to taste some liquor in it and it should probably come in a giant margarita glass, like at Arriba's.  I think that the owners are cheap and trying to lure a snooty crowd that likes to show their friends how to properly waste some perfectly good money!!!  I had been to the old location several times.  Won't find me coming back to the new location though.  You've failed to retain an old customer.  Oh,  and the valet parking is just irritating. I walked out and there's my car, parked 20 feet away, and I gotta wait for the guy to get it for me?  All those blue cones are enough to piss ya off!!  What other place in Phoenix is like this?  I had a hard time finding my way out!!",447408
2,Very dissappointed after all the 2nd hand hype..... The Burgers and fries LOOK great when served....but are very bland....The peanuts taste better than the burger. In the end I put this chain in somewhere between In N out and a Wendy's...with In N Out getting the edge. Definetly not worth the wait you see at lunch time...Better off going to red robins or grabbing a 5 dollar burger at Carls Jr. Soooo much grease/oil....soooo little taste!,503697

3,"Some of the BBQ was great!  But some of the lines were so long that getting up to the booth was almost impossible. There were many booths that we didn't try, because we couldn't get near them. Even the lines to get food and drink tickets were long. Not enough volunteers?\n\nFood and drink tickets were $2 - and a few places had samples for $2. That's what we were looking for - samples to try as many different  local BBQ places as we could. But many places had only full meals or sandwiches. We could have just gone to a BBQ restaurant anywhere in town and had a nice cool sit-down BBQ meal. But that wasn't the point. \n\nThe point was to try what AZ has to offer in the way of BBQ. \n\nAlso, someone needs to tell the vendors that next year they should have a sign up in the back of their tent giving their storefront location. When we tried something we liked, we had to inquire as to where they were located in town. \n\nMarketing folks! Marketing! Especially if you want folks to find your restaurant.\n\nAlso, whomever came up with the idea of stand in this line to order and move over to that line to pick-up must have not been using their noodles. Even fast food joints make you show a receipt or ticket that you have paid. If you were standing in the pick-up line here you got food. \n\nNo questions asked. Not a good business model . . . even for one day.\n\nIs this an annual event? Well, if so, someone needs to work on the logistics before next year.  A lot could be done to make this an event that really shows off the valley BBQ community. It kind of had the feeling of being thrown together at the last minute. Was it?\n\nNeeded more shade. Needed more places to sit and eat. The band needed shade. This is AZ folks. The sun is hot.\n\nOh, yeah, parking was free and seemed to be very well organized!",558581

The Wynn itself is $40 for dinner and it doesn't even top this place. \n\nI've tried both their lunch and dinner and to me, I liked the dinner more because I enjoyed the dinner choices more. \n\nThe dessert area at this place is SO YUM.

2,"I should have walked a bit further some more bad mall food.\n\nThe food is reminiscent of Denny's burgers. Actually, I take that back, Denny's is probably better. It was nothing spectacular but what made my experience and EWWW was that I opted for a seat at the counter, where I could watch the food being prepared. Bad idea.\n\nEverything was dipped in butter before hitting the hot griddle also, I couldn't help but notice the filthy supposed-to-be-white uniforms everyone was wearing. Inmates have cleaner clothes.\n\nBecause this was in a mall, it was extremely busy and it took a while before the food made its way to us and even getting a refill was difficult. \n\nI do like the 50s music and liked singing along obnoxiously.

4,"Ritter's will never be a fine dining establishment. It will always be a diner. It will always be a standby. It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.\n\nEveryone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry. Every now and then, I do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it is tasty.",3441

There was a 20min wait so we headed to the bar where we encountered a less than happy bartender. This is my 2nd time here and same rudeness at the bar. I asked for a glass when he gave me my beer and I never got one, same issue last time I was there.  We were seated in 15min. Our waiter was great. Our order included a hamburger and I got a rib eye. I ordered it med and got rare and there was way more fat than meat. terrible. My steak was not good the last time I was there but thought I would give it another shot. nope, just as bad.  the only food that was good was the corn on the cob, all other food, horrible. The band is too loud. All I could think of is when are they going on break!  another reason why I wanted sit outside so I wouldn't have to listen to that God awful loud music.

1,"so very disappointed. bellagio used to be one of my favorite vegas buffets, and now it has been reduced to the worst on my list.\n\nthe variety was simply lacking. and worst of all, the quality was abysmal. there was nothing that i wanted to eat, and everything that i did eat was sub-par at best. i was stunned at the fact that the carving station only offers medium or well-done prime rib. it was far too overcooked for my taste, and the carver was rude and unskilled. after asking multiple times to slice the prime rib thinly, he continued to carve 2 inch thick slices to patrons. everyone was frustrated with the carver, his rudeness, and just the appalling waste of food because he was incapable of slicing anything less than a size of a brick.\n\nanother shocking discovery was the installation of soft serve machines and the disappearance of hand scooped gelato. this utterly disgusted me and was the final nail in the coffin. who the hell wants drippy icy ooze that melts the minute it hits the bowl? it was worse than the local sizzler.\n\nand there is an average wait of 45 minutes for this atrocity? no thanks.",178112
2,"I'm a vegetarian and normally prefer hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants, but I was in Montreal, so wanted to eat French. But I know French food is not generally vegetarian friendly, so searched for one that was and chose this one for that reason and because folks seem to love it. But I didn't. \n\nI started with a tomato salad, the only non-meat appetizer of any sort. It was pretty good, especially the herbs sprinkled throughout, but they served it on a small cutting board for some reason, which was just plain stupid. I had to try extra hard not to have it fall into my lap or get balsamic vinegar everywhere.\n\nThere were three vegetarian entrees -- a pasta, a vegetable plate, and a tomato tart. The tart sounded most interesting and French, so I ordered that. It took forever to come and when it did it looked like some poorly executed \""artisinal\"" pizza you'd get at a mall Italian restaurant trying to go uptown. It tasted better than that, but not by much. It wasn't a tart as I'd define one. It was a piece of poorly done crust, with some tomatoes and cheese, and a few greens, thrown on top, and probably put in the broiler for a minute.\n\nShortly before my tart came, the restaurant sat another couple right beside me with only about a foot separating our tables even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It made the rest of the night uncomfortable for me as a solo diner. I doubt the couple liked it either. When I finished my meal, I asked for my check, waited forever, read about 20 pages of a book without anyone paying any attention to me, and then had to flag someone down to ask again.\n\nThe music -- early Stones and T-Rex -- was the best part of the restaurant, which is pretty sad.",371131

They have a general store that had the basic's, however no Beer or wine sold.  They have 2 pools one for Adults and one for Families. I don't know if the Europeans could read the signs as there was a couple of instances where they would bring in their kids to the adult pool.

3,"Oh, fuku burger. What a colorful and moody character you seem to be.\n\nAfter a night of shenanigans, the boy wanted a treat. Having spotted the illusive Fuku-truck on our way elsewhere, we hoped they'd still be there when we were done. Around 2 AM, they were, and had a big crowd of costumed fans gathering around. Descending upon the Bank of America parking lot, you can hear their music blasting; we arrived to a song about capping people and a chorus of gun-shots and the N-word. Kind of awkward, but whatever. It seems there's a lot of repeat customers or fans that hang around the truck, as there were people parked and hanging out by or in their cars for the entire duration we were there. \n\nThere was no sense of organization in the line, just a clusterf**k of people mobbing around the lone girl taking orders. We had several people attempt to get in front of us and others asking us where the line ended. Some people stood on the periphery of the cluster and waited for 10+ minutes in the cold in skimpy costumes before getting frustrated and leaving without anything.\n\nThe music was also so loud that it made ordering a challenge unless you got in the poor girl's face or yelled at her. She took our name and put our order in. When done a guy would scream out your name  from the window, vainly competing with the music. We watched him call for 4-5 people with visibly growing aggrivation. \n\nThe menu itself was pretty simple, though I know you can customize with eggs or extra patties. We opted for the Karai, or spicy burger, and an order of their garlic fries. We ate the fries on the drive home and had the burger once there. The fries seemed like they were from a box then heavily dosed with their garlic salt. I liked the sauces that came with them, but J thought they were too salty. The fries had decent crunch and heft- they weren't potato needles or massive steak fries.\n\nOnce we got to the burger, we were disappointed. The burger had flavor but was burnt on the outside and ultra-rare on the inside. Topped with a spicy mayo, another sauce, cucumber, avocado \""cream\"" and a couple of other toppings, it had an interesting combo of textures and flavors to compliment the meatiness, but not enough to save it from being mediocre. The burger may have been more redeemable if the experience/atmosphere of ordering it hadn't put us off. \n\nThe area around the truck was trashed with half eaten food and debris everywhere. Stickers and photos covered much of the windows and the only insights we had into the kitchen was the irritated guy sticking his head out and yelling at a \""mutha fuga'!\""to get back in the truck. \n\nThis is really an instance where the business philosophy shines at the forefront. Compare these fellows to the Slider truck; The boys there sing while cooking, happily greet their customers with enthusiasm & a fist bump, maintain a clean exterior and fairly consistent food preparation. I've had a mediocre slider and forgiven them because they were so pleasant to deal with. The food here has the potential for awesomeness but I just don't want to deal with a disorderly mob to get a burger. \n\nEDIT: Bumped a star for owner response :} It's always nice to see a business taking the time to respond to criticisms directly like that.",466081

3,"I was sick and tired of buying convenience store wood... It burns up way too quick, and is usually $5 or more a bag, to boot. After a quick swipe of the ol' iPhone i found Glowing Embers, just down the street a ways from my house. There's a certain manly aspect to shambling through the woodpile, getting your hands dirty, and then going home to build a fire.\n\nTheir selection is fantastic, REAL hardwoods that take a nice amount of time to burn down. The staff was real friendly, although one of the dudes working there was pretty scary in that prison-tattoo-make-sure-you-lock-the-car sorta way.\n\nThey measured my buddy's pickup truck and did some quick calculations, saying that to fill up the bed it would be $160. Since I didn't have that much cash on me they instead directed me to a roll away cart that we could fill up to the line myself for $86. We went for the cheaper option, and I honestly don't think we could have fit another $70 worth of wood into the truck, but I suppose I could be wrong. You DO have to pay for better wood to burn, and it's not exactly plentiful in the middle of the city.\n\nI don't think I'll need another truckload anytime soon, but I do think it's definitely worth the drive when you look at what you get versus what's available at the gas station or even Home Depot.\n\nI'll probably be back for a big bag or two before winter is over.",250520
2,"This place looked very promising from the menu and the decor.  I typically enjoy any Fox restaurant, however, this restaurant is a gimmick.  \n\nI ordered the free range half chicken.  I really enjoy this dish at most restaurants, but I was disappointed.  The chicken seemed to be low quality, and was very fatty.  The iced tea was good though.\n\nIf you are vegan or have a food allergy, this restaurant will be great for you.  However, otherwise, you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan label that lacks flavor.  If you are looking for this option, then try it, but otherwise, I would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price.    \n\nJust mediocre.  And way overpriced.",485915
1,"Met a friend this morning at 10am.  I was going to pick up a bagel and then get my coffee next door at Starbucks, but I saw that Einsteins has an iced coffee carafe with refills so I just got my coffee here.  \n\nIt wasn't busy.  Bagel was tasty.  My drink was empty so I went up to refill my cup but the carafe was empty.  I went to the counter and let the guy know that there was no more iced coffee.  He tells me that he'll take care of it.\n\nI wait about 7-8 minutes and walk up to fill my cup... But it's still empty.  I remind the guy that there is no coffee and he says he'll take care of it.  \n\nI go back to my seat and talk some more with my friend.  I go back about 5-6 minutes later assuming that the ice coffee is ready... But still nothing.  \n\nThis time I go to a different employee and ask him if it's normal to wait 15 minutes for a refill of coffee.  His response is a shrug of the shoulders and \""sorry\"".  \n\nFinally 10 minutes later as we are leaving, they start brewing the ice coffee.  \n\nPoor service.  And extremely pathetic response to a customer issue.  Is nobody there empowered to say anything other than \""sorry, we'll take care of it\""????",120278
3,Great breakfast and great staff! Had the Bird omelet and it was chock full of Turkey and avocados.  Great experience.,100757
2,"We brought our mom to Pewter Rose for a \""Mother's Day\"" brunch - a week late.  I was excited because I had eaten brunch here before and really enjoyed it.\n\nArrived at 12:35 for our 12:30 reservation and checked in - the hostess said she would get us when our table was ready.  We had delicious bloody mary's at the bar and we were seated at about 12:50, right next to the closed off smoking area.  However, every time the door opened a draft of smoke filled air blew right into our table - I would suggest they actually remove that table and not seat anyone there.\n\nAbout 1pm the waiter came around to take our drink orders (he likely saw that two of us had drinks already) and came back at about 1:10 for our brunch orders.  These came out at 2pm!\n\nMy breakfast was fine (straight up breakfast) but not piping hot, my mother's (Italian omelet) the same, but my brother's biscuits and gravy were cold.  The waiter brought them back to heat them up, but by then they were nearly inedible.\n\nNot sure if they were just having some problems that day with service - a lot of people out sick? - but the experience was really quite bad.  As someone who thinks of brunch as a weekend staple, I may try again but for a restaurant at this level I would expect service to be considerably better.",79751
1,"I moved to NW LV 6 months ago and often bike 20+ miles to the strip for some poker and gaming fun. I recently arrived at the Quad to meet a friend passing through town. Upon arriving I had to lock up my bike so I asked valet if they had a bike rack. The attendant replied with uncertainty and told me \""no\"", then said \""maybe in the back\"" and then \""no\"" again. I asked the attendant specifically if there would be a problem if I locked my bike up to a post or railing somewhere. The attendant didn't know or didn't think it would be a problem. I was very sure to show the attendant my concern for locking my bike to an undesignated post but it felt okay to do so according to the response. I proceed through the valet and into the parking garage to first look for a designated bike rack or bike area. After climbing several floors I came across nothing to be designated and proceeded to look for a railing. I came across an old and obviously unused stairway and locked up my bike using a Kryptonite lock and cable to the side of the staircase. I positioned my bicycle in a very thoughtful manner to make sure my handlebars or any extremity were in no way going to block the access of the staircase. I met a friend, we joined a poker tournament and I left roughly 2 hours later. My bike was gone. No evidence of anything was left behind. Immediately it felt like a security issue vs a theft issue. It takes a lot of work to break a Kryptonite U-Lock. I was outraged but I kept my cool and expressed my disgust professionally. \nValet called up security and immediately security became sarcastic and admitted they cut my lock and took my bike because it was illegally locked to a stairway. I then quickly began to explain how I spoke with valet about the bike rack situation and how there was no concern with locking my bike to a post or railing somewhere. Of course they didn't care and had very foolish reasons why they did what they did.  They told me that I should have asked security where to park my bike and not valet, but who would ever think to ask security? Valet seems like the more obvious to me. The security continued to tell me that if I would have asked them, they would have directed me towards the Bell desk and Bell would have taken care of it for me. Who would have thought Bell will take care of your bikes for you? And why aren't the valet trained to tell you that? \n\nI demand an apology and a $25 check to cover the cost of my lock. I will not let this go until I get what I deserve but either way this casino and Caesars Management in general have lost all my respect.",632872
1,"Expensive gimmick.  Missleading website.  Wide angle lens camera makes it look big but is smaller than my kitchen.  For $25 dollars to get in, it was a real disappointment.  We felt ripped off.  Plus the free drink was absolutely aweful; it reminded me of the trash can parties we went to in college.",356065

3,"we are die hard craft steak fans. every trip to vegas is not complete without us going to that restaurant. we were told colicchio's new restaurant, heritage steak, had just opened at the Mirage about a week ago. I really put a lot of time into deciding to go with the old reliable craft steak or trying the new restaurant. Should have gone to craft. \nfirst impression: The place is not as big or up scale as craft. They had plenty of staff but the service was not fluent, ok its a new restaurant and they are working out the kinks. Ordered drinks, took a while, ok we werent there to get drunk so no biggie. ordered the lamb ribs, hamachi, and the ash bone marrow. the hamachi and the ribs were phenomenal, the bone marrow (to my disappointment) was undercooked and didnt come with any toast so eating it was a bit weird. Ordered the tabasco peppered kobe skirt and my wife had the spice roasted lobster. The steak was ok at best, definitely not the same kobe skirt that they have at craft. The lobster was overcooked in my opinion and a bit tough to chew. For desert, we had mascarpone panna cotta which was very nice and tasty. oh yeah, and they were so nice to bring us a small bunt cake looking thing since I had notated in my reservation that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary. I am sorry, but if spending $300 per couple for dinner doesnt constitute a decent desert, then dont bother bringing me a dry little cake with a candle on it. overall, did not measure to the expectations, thought the menu wasnt impressive, lacked raw seafood and not a huge selection of steaks to choose from, etc. There are too many better steak houses in vegas for me to try heritage again, sorry Tom.",616433
1,"The restaurant seemed nice at first appearance.  Appetizer -chicken potstickers were great.  The bowl size  wasn't too big. It was $9.99 a bowl  (dinner)and make bottom less bowl  ( repeat bowls) was another 4 dollars.  Not  a lot once cooked.  Could have cooked a little longer as broccoli was still completely hard and not even warm.   And the initial bowl is small.  For family of 4, it was expensive  for amount of food.  I was very excited for the restaurant to open up,  but overall  disappointed.  Felt like we rush thru the  entire process and  rushing us out the door.  Won't go again",606474

3,"Lowes Motor Speedway can be fun, for an hour or two.  These races are so long though.  I got a few free tickets from my boss for the Sprint Race and I went with a friend of mine from work.  The nice thing about racing is that you can bring your own brews inside, whereas most sporting events make you pay about seven dollars a beer.  This is good and bad, it saves quite a bit of money, but there are so many wasted rednecks.  Luckily they have cops on ever corner, or this place would be pure anarchy.  I actually left a kind of early, I can't really watch cars go around and around for that long.  It just isn't my thing.",348631
5,"So I have visited this place several times in between my first review and this review and they have managed to keep their 5 star rating. Tonight was the epitome of it all! I could not believe how delicious my meal was. I did finally try a new sauce: Kung Pao, so I don't know if that was it or not but everything was cooked to perfection. It was the busiest I have ever seen the restaurant too. \n\nThe staff, which was clearly under a lot of pressure, did not compromise their customer service at all. There was a woman helping out the chefs who was extremely courteous and would help you out with whatever you want. She kept the line moving and was very efficient. The chefs were also really nice! My mom has a food allergy. When you mention you have a food allergy they clean the entire cook top and get new utensils. Most places have an attitude because it's extra work for them. Not this place, they were very nice and were able to accommodate my mom's request. Even when she asked for the food to be cooked well done with not a lot of water, the chef said \""sure\"" and made her food to perfection. \n\nLove this place!",199227
3,"Showed up here to eat with about 10 co-workers.  Initial service was prompt with our order taken in about 2 mintues.  Drinks arrived shortly after.  I ordered the spicy pork dish which is accompanied by a small bowl of rice and the requisite Korean side dishes.  The pork was tasty, and a bit spicy, but on the fatty side.  The sides were mostly un-remarkable.  All in all, it was fun to try something new, but there was nothing here that I experienced that would bring me back.\n\nI did read the other reviews that talked about the soups, so I might have to give it another shot ... so many places to try, so little time/money.",252461
3,Went here on a Sunday morning around 9am.  Had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Had a steady flow of people showing up so the place was busy.  \n\nThe food was average for breakfast.  I had the chicken fried steak with eggs and hash browns.  My wife had the biscuits with gravy.  Both portions were big so they get an extra star for that.  The hash browns good and the biscuits tasted home made. \n\nI took 2 stars away for the seating. We sat right next to the kitchen door.  \n\nService was good.  Drinks came right away and the food didn't take long either.   The waitress was very nice and checked on us a couple times.,592556
5,"The Costco of pet supplies :-) except that you do not need to pay annual membership fees like you would at C or Sam's Club.  They are open to both business owners and individual consumers. \nOne of the vet techs at the Alta Vista veterinary clinic (Jason), mentioned this place when I told him I preferred not to go to places such as Petco or Petsmart since I try to support mostly local businesses for our family and pet needs. \nOn our very first visit, I purchased a soft crate, a mattress, a cute outfit, some Zuke's treats, among others. My daughter said \""I am not even a dog and I'm having fun looking at so much dog stuff\"" ;-)\nAlso lots of cat supplies too.\nThe prices are great. I buy a lot of things for my pets on Amazon and other online sites but if I am in the area, we would definitely stop by here. I will check out their website next.",15698

Walked around the men's department for 30 minutes looking for a particular color/style pants.  \n\nDidn't see anyone in the department for a little while and just searched on my own.  About 10 minutes pass by I see an associate.  He doesn't acknowledge me or ask if I need help.  I continues to shop on my own.  \n\nBy the end of the 30 minutes I see he's asked two other people if they needed help.  It took him a while to approach each one.  During the time he asked the other two, I walked passed the associate twice and he walked next to me once.  Never once even acknowledging my presence.  \n\nI guess I'll take my business elsewhere like Armani.  They are always very friendly there.",617951

Be sure to inquire as to the \""belly\"" fish on hand - it's the best sushi.\n\nHappy hour starts at 11:00 pm till 4:00 am - and they have a special menu for the occasion, meaning that two can eat very well for $30.00 or less. \n\nNever eaten at the Tappan bar, so can't comment on that side of the house.",298844

After waiting 10 minutes someone casually dropped off 4 waters  but nothing else. At this point we had waited 15 minutes but still had no idea who our waiter was. We finally asked the lady in the front to be moved into another section and she quickly sat us somewhere else. After that we had to wait another 20 minutes for food and finally ate after what felt like forever. This was an awful experience and the manager came over and just apologized and walked away. He didn't say anything else, didn't ask us if we needed anything. It was  a very disappointing experience especially because we have eaten here many times before. On the bright side the food was good.",184003
1,"Okay. I love chili's and my family always loved doing a quick chili's to go order for Friday dinner. Since moving with my fiance to this location, I haven't had that experience!

My fiance and I didn't get to sit down to eat till 10;30pm! And what do we find? Another chicken w/mayo with wing sauce on the side....one with wing sauce and nothing else. \n\nThese guys were not busy when I went in to the To Go entrance and seeing as they ruined this simple order twice within an hour, means they've got some pretty bad cooks, or some pretty bad attitudes. \n\nOh and the fries were cold both times.

3,"This was our first time at Grape Street and we were with people that come here quite a bit.\n\nI like the restaurant itself, the chairs are REALLY comfortable.  There are three options of places to sit: at a table, at the bar or outside.\n\n-1 Star: it's CRAZY dark inside!  I had to use my phone light to read the menu (im in my 20's people, so my eyes are still good!)  Definitely not a place to take someone on your first date since you won't be able to check them out.\n\n-2 Star: our waiter was a \""close talker\"" and kinda freaked me out.  He was nice but for some reason I didn't really care for him.  He was super slow with everything.  At the end of dinner, we asked to split the bill and they said that they couldn't.  So we asked if we could give them two credit cards, and they said yes.  Why didn't they offer that option to us?\n\nAnother Con: they brought out two dishes and probably 3 minutes later brought out the other two.  Kinda weird that the two people just sat there until the other two people were served.  Not sure why they did that.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered the Mussels: New Zealand mussels saut\u00e9ed in either red or white wine sauce and baked with parmesan cheese.  Its on the app menu, but we ordered it for our main course.  We had it with the white sauce and it had very good flavor, just a little overcooked as they were chewy.  \n\nOur one friend ordered the Jumbo Cheese Ravioli: romano, mozzarella & ricotta cheese ravioli topped with a pink sauce.  This is what he orders there all the time and says its good!\n\nOur other friend ordered Angel Hair Primavera: vegetables with pine nuts & fresh herbs in either red or white sauce.  She ordered the red sauce and said it was good.\n\nI think for the four of us, four drinks the bill came to $85 and change.  Our friends had a coupon for 20% off that was given to them the last time they were at the restaurant.\n\nI think I will definitely go again.  More wine next time and maybe an appetizer!",70297

3,"My boyfriend and I came here over the weekend while we were in town for Spring Training. \n\nWe arrived around 8 pm and it was about 40% full on a Thursday night. They had a cover band playing at a reasonable volume but there is no ambiance music playing when the band takes a break so it does get a little eerily quiet.\n\n It's \""family style\"" seating. So you could be sharing your large table with others. They do have a bar top which you can sit at, and a patio with heaters.\n\nOur server seemed a little lost or new and would disappear at times. We asked for samples of a few of their beers and she gave us the wrong ones. We decided to get the Soiled Dove Dirty Blonde Ale and another one I can't remember. Both were just ok.\n\nAppetizer - we ordered the Lumpia which are little \""spring rolls\"" with pork, veggies and a really good peanut sauce. I believe 8 came with the order. $7\n\nMain Course - North Mountain Burger w/ fries $14  and Fish and Chips $12. The  Fish and Chips didn't taste like they had been sitting in a freezer forever. The tarter sauce wasn't your normal tarter sauce but it was delicious - hints of mustard in it. The food came out quickly and hot.
