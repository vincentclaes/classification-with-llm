2,Average quality sushi at super-high prices. All about the atmosphere.,256478
4,"The atmosphere is beautiful in here- and this is why you should come.  Whomever designed this restaurant derserves a big kudos.  I love the lighting, the tile, and the glass ceiling by the patio.  I love how you can see the Bellagio fountains from the patio-so perfect, and how they remember to keep you warm here with their patio heaters. :)\n\n  It loses a star because the food taste just \""average\"" to me.  I've been here twice.  Once I got an apple salad that left me still hungry (I think it's meant of more of an appetizer than an entree), the other time I got the Classique steak (my husband and I share the appetizers of the mac&cheese, and sweet potato soup), everything was \""just okay.\""  Big portions but ordinary tastes.  \n\nThe bread was amazing through, and bread is important to me!  The warm bagette with carrot dressing (sounds gross but trust me, it was fantastic).  I might try this place for breakfast sometime after reading the reviews here.",167530
2,Tried just about everything during Christmas.  I thought it was overpriced for BLAND baked goods. No reason to come back.,255713
1,"I give this hotel 1/2 star because the 80's TV worked.  Non smoking room with an ashtray!   Smelled like a combination of smoke , dirt and urine.  The heater doesn't work, just blows cold.  Beds very hard and lumpy, sheets stinky.  daughter who can sleep anywhere,  asked to sleep in the car.",540930
5,"A little hard to find but worth the effort.  Hint, its right behind the sleepy poet antique mall.  They have pretty much all the average home brewer would need.  Plus, knowledgeable people to help.  I hear they also have a warehouse in Belmont and can order pretty much anything else.  Highly recommned.",83512
1,"terrible service!  the only advantage of this liquor store is it's close to the strip.  I went there to buy some liquor on a friday night and after I left the store, I couldn't find my phone.  So I called my cellphone to see if it's somewhere in my car.  The phone wasn't shut off and it wasn't in my car.  So I decided to call back the liquor store.  the person said they didn't find any phone.  Then I asked if I can come back and check myself.  The person said sure but insisted they didn't find my phone there.  However, when I called my phone again right after I told them I was coming back to check, it was shut off.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or they were scared of my phone might ring when I come back to check and call it again.  And just to be fair to them, I clearly remembered talking on the phone with one of my friends before heading over to the liquor store.  So the chance that I lost my phone in the liquor store is very highly! On top of that, the liquor is ghetto as hell and doesn't have plastic cup for customers.  What kinda of a liquor store is it if it doesn't even have cups?\nDon't go there if you don't want to lose your phone !",65640
3,"If you love fried chicken & chicken wings, you'll enjoy this place! I decided to check this place out when I had a craving for some chicken wings and honestly BWW just doesn't do it for me. Ironically, this location was across the street from BWW so thought eh what the heck, I'll try it. \n\nOnce we arrived it was dead! However, that didn't discourage me from trying this place. Looking at the menu, the AYCE is the best deal. At first, I was a little confused on how the process worked since the hostess/cashier/waitress really didn't explain it. But in the end I was ok with it. After an hour, then service picked up.\n\nSo enough with the fluff, let's get down to business. These little suckers are huge! Seriously the first basket with 10 pieces will get you full. Make sure to split the order with 2 flavors so you can sample at least 2 different sauces. After the first basket, each basket comes with 5. And nothing says awesome like $1 PBR to wash down the wings. For a minute there, I felt like I was a competitive eater as I raced to beat the 12-yr old kid that kept eating wings. Unfortunately I paid for it after 30 some wings.\n\nWe seriously tried every flavor - sesame soy started off good but by the 3 wing, I need something to drink. It became salty and the sauce was thick. The Garlic Parm wasn't bad but honestly just tasted like fried chicken. I love sweet chili but they didn't put enough sauce on these suckers. Remember folks, if chicken is battered and deep fried, more sauce is needed than usual especially when the sauce is thin. The hot sauces were pretty similiar to Hooters. Overall, if you're a fan of Hooters, you'll enjoy this place. It's quieter, $1 beers and big screens to keep you entertained. Plus as Stephanie mentioned freshly brewed tea!",501027
4,"There are actually things grown in the Las Vegas area available at this market, but you have to know where to look!  The California stuff is nice (citrus, strawberries and Central Valley supplements), but thanks to Gilcrease, Herbs by Diane from Boulder City and another vendor or two there is the option to buy from actual local sources.  This certainly beats any of the other Fresh 52 markets in terms of vendors and variety.\n\nThe parking was tight and I had to stalk someone for a spot.  Also, the indoor vendors are a little oddly place...why?  Not a bad idea, just unusual and strangely formatted.  Certainly a nice option for adverse weather, but that indoor venue also got crowded and congested as any setting with lots of lingering folks.\n\nI was pleased to come away with things I could never find in a commercial grocery superstore including corn shoots, a massive and beautifully misshapen romanesco cauliflower, tender and huge stalks of purple asparagus and a variety of luscious citrus without stickers attached.",512403
4,"Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.\n\nWe go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.\n\nOur first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.\n\nShortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the \""heavy\"" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!\n\nStrip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor.",257611
1,"If I could give this place no stars, I would. We placed an order online under the impression that we were paying $60 for 4 rolls. What we got instead was 16 pieces. DON'T BUY FROM THEM. They will rip you off. When we called to complain, the manager, Dave, was rude, unsympathetic that their website was misleading, and tried to blame the delivery company for making the order wrong. Talk about misplaced blame and unaccountability. Horrible business and even worse customer service.",65204
4,"I have been wanting to see \""O\"" FOREVER!!!!  My wish finally came true for my 30th birthday as a gift from the boyfriend.  :)\n\nThe stage is ridiculous.  The way it's constructed and the way it works are both mind-boggling.  \n\nThe entire show is gorgeous, and I even bought the soundtrack afterward.  During some Cirque shows, there is a lack of action around the main performance.  However, this is not the case here.  There might actually be too much side action!  I couldn't decide where to focus my eyes, and i was constantly scanning the stage for interesting characters and acrobatics/theatrics.\n\nThe only downside is that we came to the later show after a VERY filling (and wonderful) meal at Le Cirque, and midshow we were both drowsy.  I was having trouble staying awake, and the boyfriend was just about completely out.  So....I think both of us missed a great deal of the performance, which is upsetting, but was unavoidable.",181693
3,"Met up with friends on a Saturday night, so it was packed. Later in the night the number of children dropped. For something out of the ordinary, it's a good time but a but a bit expensive.",350689
5,They have gluten free protein bars now! Horray!,239165
2,"Normally a good choice.  We have ordered a number of times and have really enjoyed the food and service.  The past few times, however, something must have changed.  It took over an 1 hour and 45 minutes for our delivery tonight and close to an 1 hour and 30 minutes the last two times.  Not even an apology when delivered.  I have to say the pizza is good, when warm, but if you have it delivered, order early and turn the oven on so that you can heat it up.",345895
2,"I'm not one to write reviews, I figure if I frequent enough it should always be the same or maybe better, not in this case.  I have been to both Hilldale and Monroe many times and usually always have the Huevos Racheros, and every time I get the same response to my asking for poached eggs, \""we don't make poached eggs here.\""  \n\n I don't have a problem if it's not listed on the menu * eggs made the way you like them*  Now, it's usually a hit or miss depending on the server, but this time just rubbed me the wrong way, and the way our server said, well you may have gotten them at another location but we don't serve poached eggs, we only have a grill here.\""  What, a kitchen doesn't have pots for boiling water?  \n\nThe food was great, service was lousy, and inconsistent, and if you put a statement on your menu ALL your locations should follow suit.",87777
3,"This was the first time I have been able to attend the Brazilian Festival and I have been wanting to come now for a long time. So glad I came because I will not be returning next year.\n\nThe location is great, there's lots of space and parking available. They have the stage set up in the middle where they give great performances and have plenty of room where you are able to dance along with them if you want. They also have plenty of retail vendors and of course a small somewhat decent play area for the kids. \n\nThe food however, well I am very disappointed in that. Not enough food vendors, I believe there was only about 8-10 vendors. The Only vendor I recognized was Texas de Brazil, I did order their 3 meat sampler for $7, which of course was juicy and tender as I know their food is delicious. As for everything else, well, not impressed. I also ordered my Caipirinha for $6, which was ok. \n\nAll I'm saying is that for being a Brazilian Festival they should really have more food. The entertainment is good, the kid area can definitely improve. My suggestion, get your tickets through Groupon as you get a great value to attend and it won't feel like a waste of money when you too feel disappointed.",591841
1,"My daughter and I came here looking for furniture and items for her new apartment and we got a little sidetracked at the exercise equipment department. She'd been considering buying a treadmill, too, so she chose one to try out and found that it was \""locked\"". A salesman wandered by and asked if she was interested in buying - she said, possibly so, so he unlocked the treadmill. After trying it and thanking him, he then told her to \""come back when she was ready to buy\"", in an \""I'm not taking you seriously\"" kind of manner. Not once was he the least bit friendly or did he even crack a smile. That is the last time we will visit that particular store. Poor customer service or was he just having a bad day (although the store had just opened and there was no one else around!)? Never again!",267684
3,"Think of the Sugar Factory as a beddazzled Cheesecake Factory on steroids. It's got a large menu with just about everything on it. But, I can't tell you if it's good or bad because I only stopped by for a couple sweet treats with the family.\n\nThis place is actually broken up into four sections. The Sugar Factory American Brasserie is for dining, either indoors or on their patio overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountains. The Sugar Factory Chocolate Lounge is a more intimate space with sweets and drinks. The Outdoor Caf\u00e9, located right on the Strip, is a small outdoor counter serving up sandwiches, ice cream, gelato and other sweets. Finally, the Sugar Factory retail shop is the place to get sweets and merchandise (similar to their other shops around the Strip).\n\nThe retail shop was sensory overload -- not only with the desserts, cookies, ice cream, and gelato, but also with all the crap, I mean merchandise, to buy. Plus, the place was packed with tourists. Not the place to be if you hate crowds (as I do). We purchased three items (for around $12) and found a small, quiet 4 seat counter near the Chocolate Lounge to relax.\n\nThe wife got a peanut butter cookie that she called average (and not enough peanut butter). The kid got a small cup of chocolate ice cream, which he loved. He's 3, so of course he wasn't picky about his ice cream.\n\nI went with a key lime cupwich. It's a great -- albeit old -- concept that I'm surprised hasn't caught on with more cupcake shops. They take the bottom half of the cake portion of the cupcake and put it on top of the icing, making a sandwich. I'm a huge fan of the concept. Their version allows for a better icing-to-cake ratio and is easier to eat than most cupcakes. It looked beautiful with additional icing garnishing the top, along with a sugar-made flower and some sprinkles. It had a strong key lime flavor without being too tart. Unfortunately, the cake part was dry. \n\nI'd possibly come back to try other sweets. Maybe even the food. But, if you just want desserts I'd recommend heading to Jean Philippe Patisserie at Aria or Bellagio before this place.",504446
2,"Terrible, awful, rude service. Don't bother asking general questions about the food. The waiter seemed annoyed when I asked how many lbs is the lobster and how much per pound. Just two questions about the food. I'm sorry I want to know how many lbs and don't want a surprise bill. He didn't tell me the price so I ordered something else. WTF? Doesn't a restaurant want their customers to order one of the market price entrees? I guess not. \n\nWhile I was ordering, he seemed annoyed, snooty (lol, ok Mr. waiter) and rushed me while taking my order. I know I shouldn't expect much from a Chinese restaurant but there are other Chinese restaurants with decent service. The food was average. I'm glad I didn't get impressed with their food. Yup. I would NOT come back.",72529
3,"I've been here a couple times. It's probably one of the best breakfast places in an area not famous for good breakfast. I recommend it. You won't be blown away, but you'll be satisfied.",396252
2,"I really like the Red Rock Resort.  My friends and I stayed there so that we could do some mtn biking and watch the ncaa tournament in the sports book.  The resort is nice, clean, and not too crowded.  After staying on the strip the last couple of times, this spot is much more convenient.  I'd probably still stay on the strip if I was with my wife though, since there are no shows or fancy restaurants at the Red Rock.\n\nThat being said, I was really disappointed with the Feast Buffet.  It was about $22 which is not expensive, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the food.  I ate a little of everything, and nothing was particularly good.  Sushi was worse than what I can get at my local Ralphs.  The BBQ ribs were dry.  Hardly any fish to chose from.  Asian section was about as good as panda express.  Really, nothing great about it.  I was more excited about the Fat Burger that I got in the casino food court.  Come to think of it, I also got a great prosciutto sandwich in the casino too.  Next time, I will try the bbq place instead.  \n\nBTW, if you are staying at the Red Rock.  There's a great Whole Foods down the street that has a lot of prepared food.  You can pick up really good stuff there and bring it back.  Also, across the street was an Italian pizza/deli that was good too.",234172
5,"I absolutely love this woman!\nI have had a history with bad skin and was desperate for results. My friend recommended Milunka, and I could not be happier.\nShe takes the time to do extensive extractions and finishes with waxing my eyebrows to perfection.\nShe carries great products too!\n\nIf you're looking for someone who is fantastic with skin and treats you like family, this is your woman. I don't think you can find anyone better. Period.",579089
5,"El Conquistador serves  wonderful, fresh Jalisco-style Mexican food. All of the food is made fresh daily. Mark and Maria, the owners, are very friendly  and it feels like you're eating at their home. The chile rellenos are to die for as is the tortilla soup.\n\nif the restaurant is busy, you might have to wait a little while but the food is well worth it!",541275
2,"This is a kebab shop located on a street full of similar shops, and although you can tell by looking at the kebab meat spinning (even during closed hours) this will not be one of those greasy yet satisfying meals.\nHowever, my desire for greasy got the better of me and I ate here once. The meat was really dry but fatty at the same time (never knew that was possible!) It confuses me how there are always people in here eating. Maybe I don't know the house special?",355959
2,"I like a menu that has limited choices. However, if you're menu is limited then what you make needs to be outstanding. Both of our burgers were dry as were the buns. The egg on my burger was over hard. In all my times of ordering a \""dirty\"" burger, I've never had the egg fried hard. The point of the egg is for the yolk to soak into the bun and run over the meat. The truffle fries were a miss with the sauce tasting more like an Alfredo. We ended up sending them back and asking for plain fries suggesting maybe they were soggy because they sat too long. Server was pleasant and the wine was good. We won't return.",572850
1,"Great decoration, the gold fishes in the huge tanks in the entry are really cool. The cool playing with his noodles is great animation. \nBUT when it comes to the food, it's not the same story maybe it was too \""Chinese food\"" for us. \nHubby took roasted duck, but there was not much meat but lots of bones to chew on. \nDaughter took a slightly spicy (they say) beef with hand pull noodles that burned her mouth. \nI was luck with the safe chicken and mushrooms and hand pull noodles. \n\nBasically, we will not come back never ever! \n\nTake pictures, but go eat somewhere else.",369398
5,Lemongrass chicken sandwhich is amazing and wonderful flavored tea. Carrot cake is realy yummy too.  Wish Vegas would have more Vegan and Organic cafes like this!,469188
3,"My first OPH experience was here back in 2005. When my friend and I went we didn't have much of a wait. Tried the Dutch Baby and it is HUGE. Can't say I'm a big fan of that dish, I mean it's good and all but after eating a quarter of it you want something with a little bit more variety but hey that's just me.",201486
3,"A small bar in a basement that smells like old beer and has really bad karaoke - surprisingly fun!  I am going to need to go back for a better review, but hey, I am not scared to go back.....",82339
2,The bartenders were to busy playing with there friends. I didn't feel welcomed.,528464
4,"We were given an exception when I booked a reservation for 5 on a Friday evening - normally they only take 6 or more. I asked for a red blend and was offering a fantastic Italian Cab Sauv/Sangiovese for a reasonable $6/glass. \nThe place looks clean but I did see a fruit fly or two around my meal and table. \nService was very fast (so fast my friend \""complained\"" her food was TOO hot!) and attentive. \nI had the zuppi de pesce. I asked for no squid but it was still on my plate. Normally most place cannot cook squid well and it was confirmed here. Sliced with skin and rubbery with a too salty flavor that tells me not only was it old but overcooked. However the sauce was very tasty, pasta was al dente n the rest of the seafood cooked well - although the mussels were a little briny. \nI also got to try a chicken dish with an amazing white cream sauce prosciutto and I think peas. A little jealous I didn't get this dish! \nDid not visit the restrooms or the bar area. Four stars for the seafood snafu, but I'd go as high as 4.5",82478
2,"Went to Villalpando's with some friends because they like this restaurant.  I had no idea where it was, until we got there.  It's located at Chandler Blvd just east of I-10.  Years ago, it was a sports bar filled with TV's, but they are long gone.  I don't eat anything green (except peas), so finding something to eat there was a chore.  I normally have a red chili beef burrito when I go to a Mexican restaurant, but they only had green chili.  I ended up eating a bean and cheese burrito, which was very good.\n\nI agree with the other reviews of this place... it's not bad, but not great. I'm sure my friends would disagree.  They love it.  The prices are fantastic.  For the beer drinkers, no beer on tap.  Only bottles.  Unlike the sports bar, I hope they survive, because the place was dead on a Friday night.",327249
2,"I was a person that used to go to Serendipity since it opened in 09 and to be honest it  has been going downhill.  There were many problems I had with my last experience there a while back.\n1.  Prices are ridiculously expensive for majority of the food and drinks I remember when the Deep Fried Oreos used to be 14 dollars and now it's 18 IF you are a total rewards member\n2.  The ice cream I received for the Black and White Sundae was old.  The waiter tried telling me that they get \""Fresh\"" ice cream every day, but I'm a local who used to be a regular and I KNOW for a FACT how the ice cream is supposed to be like.  I'm pretty sure most of you know that when you put your spoon through ice cream it should be smooth and creamy, there SHOULD NOT BE ANY ice crystals inside of the ice cream making it a bit hard and chunky.  I mean its sad that the Ice cream at McDonald's is a lot more fresh than this place gave me for their Black N White Sundae.  Not only that but the Strawberry was pretty lazy to me if they raised the prices.  The reason why it's called a black and white sundae isn't because chocolate and vanilla ice cream, they used to have the strawberries in tuxedos now it's just half dipped in chocolate and white chocolate. I was dissatisfied with this and this was the first time I ever had to RETURN AN ORDER OF ICE CREAM\n3.  The LV Burger was OK wasn't really worth the price to me at all.  If the price was lowered a bit it would have been a lot better.\n4.  The people gave us the grasshopper in exchange for the horrible Black N White Sundae and it wasn't that great it was mediocre at best.  It was OK, but not anything too phenomenal at all.\n\nI would recommend just going here once now just to say you've been here or get like a Frozen Hot Chocolate to go, but other than that you can find something better",383044
4,"The completion of the new shops and waiting area in terminal 1 has defintely elevated McCarran from the ho-hum airport it had been to a functional, modern, transportation hub..  The facility is clean, efficient, and well organized.  I was able to move from ticketing counter to gate in less than 15 minutes the last time I passed through.",119282
2,Overall I was unimpressed.   Nothing really that exciting here.   I am looking elsewhere.  \nFor those who are concerned about where their meat comes from you should be aware that their chicken is inexpensive but it is from Gold n Plump and Purdue.   I don't know where their beef is from.\nThe shop is nice but much smaller than I expected.  About half being a regular convenience store.   The meats are nicely displayed and they are well staffed.,11520
2,I had a handtossed pepperoni pizza which was great but the bone less chicken was pathetic 8 dry tiny pieces in a big ass box 15 $ for both now thats rediculous u don't think I will get any chicken again!,53813
2,"First of all don't buy more than one yelp coupon at a time cause you can only use one at a time and they stated that they prefer to give one ticket per table. Now I'm stuck with 2 more coupons that I probably won't use. The salsa was a little hot for me but the chips were fresh and delicious. We got the cheddar quest and it was delicious as well. I was very exited for the creamed corn side dish and it was a little hot for me but was delicious and I ate it even though my nose was running from it. I ordered the quesadilla and it was just basically plain chicken and cheese. Finally something not burning my mouth. My dinner guests had the Barbacoa burrito, which was huge, and the tilapia Cesar salad which looked good. Everyone ate all of their food! The service is where this place goes down hill. Had to wave her down for everything and wasn't overly friendly. If your going for the food it's pretty good just don't go there looking for the best service.",485441
4,"Pretty good for a cheap Vegas buffet. Cleaned good size shrimp, ok prime rib and all u can drink beer and wine included!",349981
5,"I'm usually pretty wary of places that are \""hyped up\"" by the yelp community, cause more often than not they actually suck, but this place is actually good, surprisingly so.\n\nIt's called Secret Pizza because there's no flashing lights and a million advertisements pointing to the place. Which I'm sure they think is very edgy, but I just enjoy watching idiot tourists walk around searching in desperation for a sign to show them the way. Think you're in the wrong city for that.\n\nThe wait was a little long, but it was reasonable considering the high volume of shmoozies that were there. My friends and I stick to our traditional and delicious plain cheese pizza, and it was large and awesome. Not too greasy, a very generous size for a large, and the price is right.",495894
3,"I desparately wanted to love this place, after recommendations from the hotel, a bunch of website, open table and yelp...\n\nunfortunately, my husband's fresh fish of the day (Halibut).. lacked flavor (even basic salt) and the oomph we hoped to find at a top-rated expensive restaurant. \n\nWe went here for our third anniversary-- and although my cod with porcini was tasty, it was nothing spectacular.\n\nCalimari was also very basic-- but I dont think there is anything you could really do with calamari-- however, I would like to comment that it was not overly chewy and very fresh.... \n\nOur service was impeccable and the the ambiance is delightful... BUT, I dont think I would be back, and if you are into picking a place for its great \""look\"" and nice area, then go...\n\nbut dont expect an amazing culinary experience-- just a decent one...\nbecause it was a good experience, just not the best.",336642
2,"I loved the food that wasn't the problem,  it was the service.  I asked for water two different times and he comes back fifteen minutes later and asked me if I wanted water.  That pissed me off.  I also don't like it that you have to order an entree in order to get chips and salsa.  That's a staple at mexican restaurants where I come from and there are many in Las Vegas that will give you chips and salsa before your meal.  They want to charge you otherwise.",357162
3,"Certainly a decent option if you are looking for a healthy alternative to all the fast food places nearby. Pizza was good, not great. Salads were a bit underwhelming. The descriptions on the menu are better than the actual item.\nSpace is nice enough, better for lunch than dinner.",251294
4,"Nothing says\""Welcome to Vegas\"" quite like a casino set up inside the airport!  It seems like as soon as you get off the plane you're hit with the blinking lights and ding ding of the slot machines.  \n\nBut seriously, let's get to the important part.  FREE Wifi!!!  Do I need to say anymore about that?\n\nThe other important part, the food choices.  I hate when the only thing offered in an airport is fast food options or sit down restaurants.  I want a nice balance that's fast and not fried.  There weren't many of those choices, unless you wanted to grab a pre-made sandwich from one of those corner grab and go stations.  Meh.  Good thing was you can scrounge up something and at least there are options.  I've been to some airports were there's hardly anything in the terminal you're parking it at for 2 plus hours.  Thee worst!\n\nAnother plus, it's literally minutes from The Strip.  Being from a city (Pittsburgh) that has an airport more than 20 minutes outside the city limits, that's a big plus!  I want to get to the party fast and leave all my \""sins\"" quickly:)",119585
3,Jimmy john is one of my favorite place to grab but after tonight it went down hill. I ordered a vegetarian sandwich and took it home once I got home it had ham and what not. It was the worst sandwich I ever got!!!! I called and they said I'd have to go drive back to get the sandwich I wanted in the first place. This is dumb and very annoying.  So to warning to all customers check ur order before going home.,523972
4,"Had the pulled pork sandwich, fried okra, mac-n-cheese, and sweet potato pie. With a drink the bill came up to under $10. Great food and great prices.",364443
5,"I don't do caffeine anymore, or calories for that matter... so this is my fave place to eat yummy & healthy guilt free food!\n\nThey can make pretty much any tea you can think of- I used to love chai(but I'm off caffeine, remember?) so now I always get the vanilla rooibus tea  with soy milk & a little splenda of course.  And I love their roasted chicken salad for lunch.  Something about the way they make it- I wonder what the secret ingredient is!\n\nBest part- when you get a salad or sandwich, you can add on a large tea of coffee for just $1.\n\nWhat more can you ask for?",368317
3,"Had the poutine with onions and mushrooms. It was very tasty for my first time trying this dish. \n\nI also tried a Nutella, banana and strawberry crepe upstairs. It was a more crispy than I would have liked.\n\nThe service was good overall",472513
2,Stumbled across this restaurant with a friend visiting in and decided to take a chance with it and do I regret making that choice.\n\nWhen we went in it looked busy and took a while for them to stay us but then we were led into the other dining area which was nearly empty (only about three or for people exited from here when we entered). \n\nI ordered the chicken pad Thai and all three of us got a mango smoothie. When the food came my chicken in the pad Thai was tough and dry although the noodles were okay. When or drinks came they gave my friend a cup that was filled 75% compared to mine. When my friend complained they said it was because it was all that was left in the blender after pouring the previous two. Could they not have bothered to put in the effort to make a bit more so it didn't look as bad? It really wasn't that busy.... Service was bad to begin with as well and slow. \n\nNerve coming here again.\n\nOverall two stars both for service and quality of food.,518429
3,My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for our anniversary since everyone recommended it to us. We went here on a Friday night; reservations for 7:30 and we were seated around 7:45. Not bad! It was pretty busy which I expected since it was a Friday. \n\nWhen we were seated our server explained the red side and green side. I noticed all the meat they had and the salad bar. I decided to go to the salad bar before eating some meat. The salad bar looked delicious! I was excited to see that they had lobster bisque as the soup of the day. \n\nThey had a lot of meat to choose from. I wasn't too impressed with some of the meat because some of it was loaded with sodium. The chicken was a little dry and the sausage was just a-ok.,347547
4,"I can't believe I've never reviewed switch! Switch is pretty solid when it comes to food and service.  I've only eaten here for dinner once, but their lunch and happy hour are both very good. I work about a block away, so it's a great place to grab a bite, and they usually can get you in and out of there in an hour.  So far I have tried the black bean veggie burger and the Caprese sandwich, both are delicious! They have wedge and sweet potato fries which makes it really hard to choose, but after trying both I prefer the wedge fries which is surprising for me, but they're really that good!  Yesterday the table next to me ordered the mac n cheese, it looked fantastic! I'll be giving that a try soon.  The girls and I decided to splurge at lunch yesterday and ordered the red velvet cake.  I'm not a huge cake fan, but this was very moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. Another quick tip for switch... they take reservations, even for lunch!",279401
4,"All you can eat is the way to go!  I really love the spicy seafood mix and the nigiri here.   As for strategy, go for non-rice items first and then slowly move toward rolls.  Save your stomach for dessert especially the mochi.\n\nIt's just so good here and the price is amazing for what you can get!  There are so many choices here that it boggles the mind.  I love choices!  The sushi here is great and you get more than what you pay for.  I didn't have any fishy taste when I ate it.  Definitely fresh and so delicious.\n\nThe parking is ample and it is very close cramped seating.  Expect a wait during dinner time. The service was amazing!  It's one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas and I can't wait to return back!",142153
1,"Awful restaurant! This place USED TO BE AWESOME when it was Lolita's. The new-age Mexican food they offered was flavorful and every dish was a culinary experience. Since this place became Coconuts the food has turned to crap. Everything we tried was overcooked, under seasoned and swimming in tasteless sauce.  Tables were sticky and dirty, not tablecloths, and poor service given.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and do not come to eat here. It's a waste of time and money.",531122
3,"It was our first time to visiting ,it was cute decor . Love the patio , the soloist musician was great. The service was good. Our server advise us that our food was going to be 45 minutes wait. We were OK with that because we had time. So you are in a hurry don't go . We get our food we were not impress at all. I had the chili rellano dinner , they cover it with some red sauce it taste like ketchup. The guacamole had no favor at all. After spending $100 for 3 meals, 6 beers, and one appetizer we just where not impress at all. On our way out we hear a great band, now they do have a great band . We actually stay  a little bit more just to hear the band . so we decide if we want to listen to some great music we will go , but if we wanted to eat great mexican food we will go elsewhere.",99388
3,"I first have to say that the veggie eggroll is awesome! Very few asian spots make good eggrolls. Try it!\n\nA friend and I met here for lunch one day, it was our first time there for the both of us, and we were presently surprised with the affordable lunch specials and quick service. \n\nBesides the eggroll I was raving about, the food was good. Lunch portions were decent, so the value of your dollar is good here.",227700
2,"Maybe it's the secluded location or perhaps the strange after taste of the broth left on your tongue.\n\nWhatever the case be, I really am not a fan of the place. The restaurant is pretty spacious with a karaoke stage to your left upon entering. There's a big \""fruit tree\"" located in the middle which is a nice sight. However, the wait time for food is rather long. I went here with a group of 7 and had to wait about 40 minutes for food? Nothing comparable to Pho Kim Long (my go to place for pho).  \n\nI'm pretty easily fulfilled with pho from any place, but I was just thrown off by the after taste of the broth as stated above. My final verdict? If you can get pho somewhere else - go for it.",285485
5,"FREAKING AMAZING ! I am biased brother-in-law works here, however this is a fabulous place to grab not so commonly seen foods. Chef Matt and the rest of creative minds did a wonderful job, fabricating this tantalizing menu of compliment off of one another.",643250
3,Food isn't that good. Don't know why people love it so much. The customer service is okay but they are quite and don't really talk. My favorite thing is the ice tea wow it's amazing! But other then that it's cool. An upgraded KFC with not  a lot of stuff on the menu.,524389
3,"My favorite thing about this hot spot? The gelato bar! What buffet do you know that has all you can eat gelato with a good variety of flavors? This alone made my trip worth it! Not to mention the rest of the delish assortment of desserts! \n\nOne thing that you should be aware of is that the seafood buffet is only available on Fridays-Sundays for only 29.99. I unfortunately was not because I was ready to get my seafood fix during lunch on a Monday until they told us the reason why the lunch buffet was only $15 was because it's only on the weekends... Boohoo! Exactly why I took  a star off along with the next star because of their limited sushi bar that was not so great, which I wouldn't expect greatness at a buffet anyway, but they should have at least given more of a selection. The lamb shoulder however, was yum! \n\n$15 on weekdays for lunch, $22 for dinner... Same price for the weekends without seafood but with it's 29.99, which I think is a great price compared with the prices on the strip that's not as great... Belagio is still one of my faves!",378025
1,"There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""rewards\"" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them.",42781
1,"Gold Rush Jewelry Design, owner, Alfonso is extremely unfriendly and rude.  Before you buy anything at his shop, be absolutely sure you like your merchandise and unlikely to change your mind about it BECAUSE once bought your merchandise and left his shop, there is NO after sale service whatsoever.

3,"Despite their great croissants, I swore I'd never go back to Scratch after about my fifth or sixth run-in with their bratty staff (However, FWIW, the owners are quite nice). \n\nAfter almost two years I acquiesced to my desire and was pleased to find that the croissants are still the best I've had in the states and better than all but the very best I've had in France and Quebec.\n\nNo opinion on if the staff is any better. The service was totally underwhelming but not as openly hostile as they were in the past. Their croissants (especially pain au chocolat) are truly five-star and the rest of the food is generally good but I'm still quite wary of the staff.",306925

1,"If you don't like having smooth, relaxing craps, and pleasure yourself in hot, anus ripping diarrhea, then look no further- Basha on Sherbrooke and University is the place for you!\n\nThis lovely little toilet nightmare is placed in the basement suite of an old, semi-abandoned office building, sharing its prime real estate with a shady currency exchange store that opens for only 3 hours a day and a Tim Hortons above it that, for lack of a better word, is as pleasurable in dining as is eating the asshole an obese computer technician named Fred.  The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.\n\nThe food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights.",337877

The chicken of the chicken and waffles was delicious.  I can't go the full 5 only because I found the waffles to be a little bland.  I was a little envious of the giant pancake at the table next to us.

1,"Was excited to visit this place because I love desserts and dessert drinks.  My husband invited a group of people to meet us there after dinner. My sister in law and I walked right in, but my husband and a friend were stopped and told they were not within the dress code. My husband wore jeans, a sweater and dress shoes and was both confused and irritated; we have been to lounges and places  in Hollywood with him dressed the same way and have never encountered a dress code problem.  To make matters worse, when my husband pointed out that there was a \""fairer skinned\"" person right before us, who was let in wearing a T-shirt, the manager simply said, \""To imply that I am a racist is ridiculous.\"" He then told us to leave and later threatened to call the police.  This type of treatment was extremely disappointing; and to think, I thought Charlotte was considered the \""New South.\""",384266
4,This place is the bomb.  We bring all our visitors here.  They have good fresh seafood at very reasonable prices.  We like to get the trifecta seasoning mild.  You go here for the food and the fun environment.  I have been several times and will be back several times.,626358

3,"This would be a great place to watch a game. The food is kinda overpriced...but decently good. The traditional wings are my favorite, Asian Zing and Medium with a side of Ranch! \n\nIf you're going to order an appetizer, stick with the fried pickles. They're the only thing that's marginally different from something you could get pretty much anywhere else.",544799
5,"The Buffalo serves wings, boneless wings, boneless wings sandwiches, and salads that can be ordered with or without wings.  I like my wings with the bone, otherwise known as tradition wings.  There are some twenty odd flavors.  Currently, I get half hot and half Thai curry.  Top that off with some fries, ketchup, carrots, and blue cheese and you've got yourself a lunch special.  The loyalty card is a nice perk, $5 off every few meals or so.  The servers are very generous with the punches.  And if I ever managed to fill out the survey from the receipt, I would be saving even more moolah.  For a little bit, I was using SCVNGR to unlock some deals.  It is an app that requires you to complete challenges, and if you get enough points, you can unlock deals.  It was fun for a few weeks, but then seemed like a lot of work.  They've also got drinks, but come on, man, this is my lunch break.",478465
4,"Went to see local bands play here last night with Amy D and her awesome friends.  Totally my kind of bar...dark, dirty, divey, and with killer bands playing.  Very spacious...but that could have something to do with the fact that the place wasn't really packed. \n\nI didn't drink this night, but I did notice that Budweiser was $6.  (Not a beer drinker, but that seems a little high, I think)  But somebody was buying the drinks.  I think last night was the first time I actually had a guy fall on top of me. (And I guess my response was priceless)\n\nThe bar is in a strip mall, so parking wasn't too bad.

3,"We go to Madison about once a month for various Badger sporting events. Sometimes we do double-headers and have to find somewhere to kill some time between the two events. \n\nLet me put in here that I was a little disappointed by Yelp Madison - the top 10 reviews are for bakeries and coffee houses, making it difficult to find what locals think is a great place to eat. \n\nAnyway, we ended up choosing the Old Fashioned a few days in advance, so I spent some time looking at the menu online and was really looking forward to trying some of their food. \n\nBecause of the timing of the events, we got there about 4:30. The place was still pretty busy considering it was pre-dinner time. It's a good thing we got there at that time, since it was absolutely stuffed to the gills by the time we left at 6. \n\nDespite having like 140 beers, they carry just one hard cider, which I think is a little ridiculous. But I ordered it. It wasn't very good. \n\nSo I perused the giant beer menu and went for an apple New Glarus I'd had elsewhere and loved. They were out of it. And before I could even go back to the menu, the waitress let me know they were out of 2 other fruit beers. However, the waitress suggested a beer on special that, based on the name, I'd never had tried, but it was quite good. So good on her for knowing the flavor profiles of what they had available. \n\nSince it was early, I was still pretty stuffed from lunch and the meals there all looked huge. I knew from Yelp that the fried cheese curds were a must and I couldn't imagine how I'd handle a whole meal, so I decided to piece on together. \n\nI ordered the curds for us to share, then ordered a side of the dill potato salad and a bowl of the beer cheese soup. \n\nThe curds were as advertised - spectacular. But everything else was a disappointment. \n\nThe beer cheese soup is clearly made with sharp cheddar - it had that good, sharp bite. But it was also incredibly gritty because hard cheese like that doesn't melt well. You could see the gritty pieces all over the spoon. It was just an unpleasant texture.\n\nAlso, because it was so sharp, it was kind of a lot - if you know what I mean. It needed some bread or a pretzel or .... something to break up the strong flavor. It came with a small packet of oyster crackers, but those just soaked up the soup and didn't accomplish anything. \n\nAnd the dill potato salad didn't taste anything like dill. It was ok, but not great, but I as someone who loves dill, I was really looking forward to it so the lack of flavor really disappointed me. \n\nSo I think the food was probably pretty ok, but after reading the menu I was really looking forward to these things and they failed to meet my expectations. \n\nThe boyfriend, incidentally, had the Saturday night Prime Rib special and it was delicious. He ordered the \""small\"" and the plate was huge, with a giant mound of onion strings, which I don't think he even touched, plus a baked potato and the Prime Rib. The Prime Rib was melt-in-your-mouth. \n\nI wish my meal had lived up to the promise of one bite of his. \n\nWe were in the room off to the left of the hostess station and there is a long bar there. As the restaurant got more and more crowded, so did the bar and there just wasn't room for all those people. Folks were bumping into the back of the BFs chair and the servers couldn't even get through.",179360

Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni & sausage and garlic, 3 cheese Stromboli and garlic knots....OMG the garlic knots!!! They were fluffy pillows of buttery, garlicky goodness that not only smelled good but made our mouths water as their wonderful aroma filled the air around us. The pizza was BETTER than the NYC pizza I had in NYC and made me feel good knowing I don't have to travel 3000 miles to get amazing pizza. The crust was thin, crisp and chewy, sauce was perfect, cheese is good quality and toppings very generous. We will definitely be back and spread the word.

We had delicious bloody mary's at the bar and we were seated at about 12:50, right next to the closed off smoking area.  However, every time the door opened a draft of smoke filled air blew right into our table - I would suggest they actually remove that table and not seat anyone there.\n\nAbout 1pm the waiter came around to take our drink orders (he likely saw that two of us had drinks already) and came back at about 1:10 for our brunch orders.  These came out at 2pm!\n\nMy breakfast was fine (straight up breakfast) but not piping hot, my mother's (Italian omelet) the same, but my brother's biscuits and gravy were cold.  The waiter brought them back to heat them up, but by then they were nearly inedible.\n\nNot sure if they were just having some problems that day with service - a lot of people out sick? - but the experience was really quite bad.

4,"I've stayed here twice but the last time I stayed was a couple of weeks ago as part of my honeymoon. The check-in line was long and kinda dragged, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Everything else was great. \n\nThe lady checking us in upgraded our room for free since we mentioned we were on our honeymoon. We got a spa room, which is just a room with a hot tub in it. I LOVED the view from the room! We were on the 33rd floor with a great view of the strip. The bed was comfortable, the hot tub was great and I loved the fact that there weren't a lot of rooms on our floor. We didn't hear much activity up there and felt like we had the whole floor to ourselves. \n\nWe ate at a few different places while we were there. We knew to stay away from America since a lot of people got sick there, according to a few reviews. I tried the buffalo wings and fries from the Sportsbar restaurant (I can't recall the name). The wings were ok but instead of dipping the wings in the buffalo sauce, they cooked them in it so they came out a bit dry. Still pretty good if you dip them in ranch. The fries were really good! We had one order of the regular fries and one order of the parmesan fries. Get the regular fries. My husband got the sliders. They were ok. \n\nWe then tried a place that was famous for it's burgers. I can't recall the name of this place either but you can't miss it since it's around the same area as the Sportsbar place and they literally have all kinds of burgers. It's their thing. I really liked that place. The burgers were good!! The service there was awesome. The waiter we got was very attentive and made sure we always had our glasses full. \n\nAs for the gambling, I don't gamble much but I did play a few of the slots. They were ok. \n\nOverall, I would stay here just because the rooms are comfy and I always get a room with a nice view.",160864

I was told I could not sit at a booth because there were only two of us and we would need at least four. His reasoning was \""it might get busy\"". Instead we were seated at a small table where the game we were there for was almost impossible to see.  Pretty much every request was answered with NO for the entire meal by the waitress.  I had multiple experiences like this and finally had enough. I would go to the Tilted Kilt  or Arena just a few blocks away",252354

1,Went there for memorial day weekend the racist bastard at the door did want to let me in because of my foreign Belizean ID from the Belizean Embassy in Los Angeles. He was very rude to me and my party yelled at us and told us to leave the building or he would call the cops. It was a very stressful ordeal now Rehab dont want to refund us our money.I left emails and called and still no response. They need to learn to respect customers. Iam 28 years old and was being treated like a minor trying to use a fake ID.... I will never give up..,231439

4,"I have been coming here since 2006. Before it was named Mint Bistro, it was called Himilayan & Napalese Cuisine. They used to not have a lunch buffet. The lunch buffet is great. I go to UNLV and I used to come here often for lunch. The owners are really nice. They food is really flavorful. They try to change the entrees up as often as possible. There is always chicken tandoori, and Kheer, which is all that I need to make me happy. Sometimes they have Saag, and it's so delicious. The music is nice and the ambiance is very pleasant. They have vegan and vegetarian dishes and an assortment of appetizers that go really well with mint chutney. They also have fresh fruit and salad. It is well worth the ~$9.00.",143918
2,"I used to come here when I lived in student halls, and I was always taken aback by the limited time we got to keep the DVDs. \nIt's a sad fact that almost all DVDs I have rented here aren't in the best condition. I guess it comes with a DVD rental place. \n\nIt is quite large and slightly shabby looking but definitely has a lot of choice. However, their european/foreign movie selection is somewhat disappointing. Plus in what self-respecting DVD shop would it take them ages to locate Nemo?\n\nSo if you are after a blockbuster (ha pun to the name!) or something along those lines you will find it here. Ask for the student discount if you have an approved uni card.",356017
2,"Dined here last Friday night (10/24) with friends for a 40th birthday party.  Table for 10.  The food was 50/50, and priced accordingly but the service was all but non-existent.  Ordered items missed and/or served under or over cooked, no checking on drinks, and no quality checks.  Just like the Eiffel Tower restaurant in this hotel, this establishment goes in the \""poser\"" category - a place with the facade of a high-end food experience with the reality of an Applebees. \n\nI discussed the evening with the shift manager...she took the automatic 18% tip off of the bill then told us that we \""were only hurting the servers\"" (out of guilt, we tipped back about 10%).  So to sum up:\n\n- Mediocre food\n- Bad service\n- Management that makes YOU feel guilty for their shortcomings.\n\nWith so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I recommend giving this place a pass.  None of us will be back.",168606

The ice cream comes in an assortment of flavors, from standards to some interesting unique ones, and from what I understand all of the dairy products used by the shop come from the owners' area farm.\n\nIn short, with ice cream like this, it's a wonder anyone within driving distance would ever go to Baskin Robbins or Coldstone.",371394
1,"DIRTY.  Dirty, dirty, dirty.   I was excited to have a corner suite at Aria, but I sat on my couch and pulled a pair of dirty women's underwear out from under a couch cushion.  Then, in the awesome bathroom, I dropped my hairbrush on the floor, and when I bent down to get it, there were 4 Xanax on the floor, under the vanity.  Neither of the above items were mine; we had just checked in.  I asked to change rooms and a room upgrade, and they told me that would be difficult.  They put an equal room on hold for me, but I couldn't get into it until 6pm the FOLLOWING day.   Really more of a hassle to move rooms.  Then, later in my stay, as I was walking from the shower to my room, I sliced the bottom of my foot open on a carpet staple/nail that was loose.  Hurts like hell.   Since I had already officially \""checked out\"" online early that morning, they wouldn't do anything about that.   For all of this, in a 48 hour stay, after talking with the management for a day and a half, they finally offered me a $100 credit on anything inside the hotel.  $100 does not buy 1 show ticket, or 1 spa treatment.  I still had to spend more money there.   I could not use $100 on food, since I was at a work conference. Some BS if you ask me.  I will not return to the Aria, would not recommend it, and will not stay there next year, if the conference is there again.",375619
1,"**THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUD MONEY STEALING BLACK HOLE.**\nDo not trust this company with any of your car rentals. I arrived a few hours earlier than the reserved pickup time. I asked if it was alright to pick up the car earlier than the reservation without any extra charges and they said it was fine and I already reserved the car for the extra hours (supposedly). I put a $27 insurance on top of for the day, thinking it was a simple $27 charged. A $92 total balance for the rental for one day in Vegas wasn't too bad. THING AGAIN! I was billed an extra $114! For a total of $186 for ONE DAY! I argued with the manager who gave a \""I could care less\"" attitude and said the extra charges where a 40% tax on top of other fee's in relation to the insurance I accepted and the EXTRA HOURS. They never mentioned these fees when I went to pick up my car, and ofcourse they charged me for the extra hours which they stated at first were already included in the $72 previous balance when I reserved the car.\n\nI wasn't able to get my money refunded. \n\nDON'T TRUST YOURSELF WITH THIS COMPANY.

The nice thing about racing is that you can bring your own brews inside, whereas most sporting events make you pay about seven dollars a beer.  This is good and bad, it saves quite a bit of money, but there are so many wasted rednecks.  Luckily they have cops on ever corner, or this place would be pure anarchy.

3,"We tried Finz on impulse.  It was pretty good!  We had the Cajun Shrimp Steam Pot which was huge, I am glad we shared it between two people because it was a lot of food, the shrimp are huuuuuge.  We also had a tuna appetizer that I am not sure if it was on special or on the menu, but it was really good.  The mac and cheese was a little chewy, not great.  We got to pick our seats, we tried outside but the amount of smokers out there was terrible.  They should make the restaurant non-smoking in this day and age.  It is a dive-like bar atmosphere though so perhaps that's why they allow smoking like that.  Our waitress was very kind and service was prompt.  Come casual, it looks fancier on the outside than it is on the inside.  The prices are a bit high for the experience.",343284

We were directed to go sit out by the fire pit if we wanted while we waited.  In about 15 minutes we were seated at a table outside on the patio.  Our server, Joe (\""hey-guy\"") was one of the best servers we've had in a long while!  He offered suggestions and we ended up with the NW Pub Burger with salad and blue cheese dressing and the Kobe Beef Burger with fries.  Both were awesome and the Pub Burger is to die for!!!  During our meal, Rene (a manager) came over to ask how we were doing.  We told him we were first-timers.  He told us to save room for dessert and during that discussion, told us we should try them all!  I told him that if they were on the house, we'd be happy to and he could come join us.  Long story short...he sent over the cherry bread pudding (on the house) and it was fabuous!  We will be regulars and can't wait to try some of the other options on the menu.  Everyone was friendly and we had a 5-star experience, top to bottom!",532216

1,"Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.\n\nZoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.\n\nThe food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.\n\nThere's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again.",14442

4,"Stopped in today after church, clean, upbeat environment.   First time here, so we asked about their most popular sandwiches.  Definitely gave a great recommendation - I went with the #9 Italian Night Club w/ hot peppers.  Good amount of meat, and other condiments.  Peppers gave it a nice little kick, even picked up a bag of their Jalapeno Potato Chips.  My only complaint is I wish the sandwich was a little bigger, it was gone, but I wanted to keep eating because it was so good.   \n\nFed a family of 4 for about $20, which isn't too bad.

Bland doesn't even describe them. We got the Sakura and Geisha roll and for all the delicious goodness that was supposed to be in them, I was extremely disappointed at how crappy they were. I was totally in the mood for sushi too, which makes it suck even more! They were a nice size, which is why I gave this place the 2 stars. At least I wasn't starving, I was just lacking good sushi when I walked out. And the service there is almost as bland as the food is. And I agree with someone who said it in another review...those seats are HORRIBLE!! Maybe it's a better nighttime spot? Who knows, I won't be going back.",381360

It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week.

I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.\n\nEveryone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry.

1,"Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \""multiple times\"" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \""Oh, you wanted another?\"" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated.",3589
5,"So you get yourself a puppy or an adult dog and you find yourself with two choices.\n\n1. Don't train your dog.

Go to dog training classes. \n\nYeah, number 2 is the right answer. For a very reasonable price ($125) we signed up Anka our brand new 3 month old puppy. Anka is a strong-willed German Shepherd with a high drive and before training was happy to do anything SHE wanted to. After completing our 8 week training class, Anka can now sit, down, wait, stay on command and come when called. She walks on a leash wonderfully now. She doesn't jump up on people any more and she is a lot more comfortable amongst other dogs and people.\n\nLeah is very knowledgeable and patient. She spends time both with the class as a whole and with your dog individually. Every one of the dogs in our class improved dramatically over the course of 8 weeks. The transformation was quite amazing to see.\n\nI picked Leah because of her history with German Shepherds, but she knows about all dogs.

Be sure to check out the Clearance sections in every department (or, you know, don't so I can snatch up all the finds).\n\nI am, however, pretty sure that the parking deck of this Target is the national headquarters for driving like an asshole.

2,"Only scoring a two star because the food was edible and the vibe of the place was very cool. After spending a lot of dough on an amazing meal at STK the night before we decided on a more casual less expensive (or so we thought!) one. Todd English has gotten a lot of buzz on Top Chef so why not? Well this is why not: the food was ridiculously overpriced, carelessly made and couldn't hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost. My $20 plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back, when it came back the flavor wasn't even up to Costco's high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce. I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was $87 before the tip!! $20 for one beer flight of four tiny tastes? Really? The only thing I enjoyed about my meal was the French onion soup but beware for $9 it'll be half the size of the one you are used to. This place is a miss for me. Not coming back unless Todd invites me to dine for free.",445505

4,"CPR re-certification is just something you have to do as a healthcare professional.  We all moan and groan about it because there are a hundred other things you'd rather be doing for 3hrs. \nHowever, I've been going to Heart Savers for quite a few years now and they have managed to streamline their system pretty well. When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix. \nThe instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category. \nThe hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.\n Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually.\nThose of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years!\nOne note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.  But I heard cheaper rates being quoted in class, as well as higher ones (you pay once you get to class).",536287
3,"Another \""do-it-yourself\"" bridal shop with rows of dresses tightly packed on racks in big plastic bags.   The woman was super quick swapping out the dresses in the room.  As soon as I walked out in a new dress, she had the old one out and the new one ready to go and waiting for me in my room.  I might have rated this store a bit higher, but I didn't seem to have any luck here.  Dresses were either way too big or way too small and I just didn't find any that I liked.  I have heard of many people having success here and the prices are reasonable, just didn't work for me.  The dress shopping continues. . .",50838

Only thing we didn't care for is the spinning salad. It has a 1,000 island base and we are Roquefort fans. But the prime rib and turkey were off the hook ! Great restaurant experience",137881
1,"This place is the wort.  Staff is friendly and maybe someday will get its act together.  They bill themselves as \""world famous\"" but I have no idea what world they are talking about.  Place is noisy,has created noxious odors throughout the Shops at the Village of SouthPark, has kids that run crazy around the fountain with little or no adult supervision. food is plentiful but also about the worst Tex Mex ever,  Do yourself a favor and run for your life from here.  So many other good places in Charlotte.  One other thing - how the h.. did Simon properties let them get away with the totally obnoxious pink exterior that is totally out of place in the Village.  Somebody needs their head examined.  Avoid this place at all costs!!!!!!",607420

4,"Very late review... For reasons to be a bit clearer in a moment. Definitely a hipster vibe as others have pointed out YET more inclusive than a crappy Chicago dive bar any day of the week.\n\nI visited during a trip I made on Labor Day weekend, just to cash in some miles and get away from the above mentioned city and its 1/3 of a summer we experienced this year. Seriously, felt like spring never ended, no Indian summer and straight into snow this week. I digress. I was genuinely concerned I'd run into the local Yelpers for whom I've had a long standing feud (although I noticed certain arch members have dropped off the face of online Yelp terra) yet I soldiered on. My concerns were lifted when I noticed a) how crowded it was. b) how young the crowd was and c) it was noticeably a hip hop night with DJ to boot. As inclusive as they pretend to be I'd never imagine to see the Yelp crowd that I knew at an \""urban\"" music setting. This proved to be the busiest venue that weekend as Phoenix was, as usual, an utter ghost town and historically so on both Memorial and Labor Day weekends - hence, the perfect weekend for a visit. I wanted to concentrate on visiting my favorite spots of old.\n\nSo, to summarize: SideBar is still open, and not taken over by some corporate chain. It's still open late nights. It hasn't lost its good atmosphere, even though it was too crowded for me that night. I am happy the Phx is retaining some culture without the CenPho idiots inserting themselves into everything nor making a pointless cause out of a new bar or restaurant constantly.",361303
1,"Gross.  Chaos.  Unhelpful.  Trashy.  Rude staff at every turn.  Hundreds of dollars in billing errors after checkout.  Maybe this place was nice the first week it opened.

1,"Too bad can't indicate zero. Used a Groupon. Food was poor, service indifferent.  Decor takes you back to the 80s but not in a good way (like a banquet hall of a Holiday Inn in Muncie Indiana).

4,"This is a nice park.  A bit set away from the happening strip.  Taxi fare if you don't have a car is maybe $30-$40 to the Mirage area. I stayed with friends and would have wanted to let them relax at the park while I went back to the strip, but with the cost, I passed.  They have a general store that had the basic's, however no Beer or wine sold.  They have 2 pools one for Adults and one for Families. I don't know if the Europeans could read the signs as there was a couple of instances where they would bring in their kids to the adult pool.  The bathrooms were clean with and each individual suite had the bathroom and shower.  The dog park was nice for those with canines.  If you have dogs, you might want to ask for a space close to that.  Also some spaces have tree's that might restrict your use of your awning.",259315

I've had 8 other Indian restaurants, and none of them have come close to being this good. \n\nFirst positive sign, everyone in the place was Indian. Second positive sign, all the food was spicy. Had to ask for a Masala Dosa for my daughter so that she could eat.\n\nDelicious. Will be back soon.\n\nThere was a TV that was too loud.

Someone asked they turn it down, and they I think didn't understand the English well enough to comply.\n\nCould be an issue going forward.",574364
3,"This club is only good when they have big name guests and DJ's. Otherwise, mediocre. Definitely not my first choice for a birthday or a random night out. Hate to say that I was sadly disappointed with \""Skribble Saturdays.\"" The music was not on point and crowd was kind of dead. The only thing that would make this club worth visiting is the view on the terrace. If you get there when they first open the outdoor area you might find somewhere to sit. The third level on the roof top is gorgeous right under the Eiffel Tower. A good time to have a table there would be around late September-October, March-April while it's nice out at night.",504196

I came here and was happy to order chicken Marsala and hear a few minutes latter the chief pounding chicken cutlets, reminded me of home. Fresh and on point, the Alfredo is out of this world and the pizzas are the same. They have a large brick over to cook there pizza and the pizza comes out thin crust as if it was made in a bakers pride oven. Don't let the outside deter you, once inside it is a very modern romantic look with a few tables. Great date spot or place to pick up to go.

3,"I love thai rama for the most part their panang curry and evil jungle noodles are always on point.  But service at this location was not on point, yeah the girl was nice but majority of the time she was on the phone with god knows who.  She rarely came over to see how our food was or if we wanted more to drink given the fact that our food's spice level was a lot hotter than what we asked for.  My friend ordered the paht thai( for some reason is always dry regardless of location)  and myself the panang curry as usual.  My friend had asked for no spices in hers and it came out hotter than my medium panang.  The girl apparently misunderstood our orders obviously since she had nothing to write down our orders on. She said after getting off the phone that it was her mistake even though apparently the chefs have been off  as far as getting the spice levels on point.  \n\nShe came back after a few minutes and said \""the cook that made your dish was...MEXICAN\"" my friend and I could not believe this white girl said that (we are half filipino) to us like that would make a difference. The way she said it was just bizzare to us. If I were part mexican I would have been pissed. It shouldn't matter what someone's race is on who is making the food.  The service was poor here our food came out spicier than called for and the egg rolls seemed lightweight stale.  Not a great way to start our day.",372817

They promise you that if you pay for the listing you can contact the owners directly. They don't mention that it's by mail only!! In addition, they have a prewritten letter they have for you to send to the owner is to request for a rent to own. I don't even want to own a home. The listing on Trulia was for rent. I thought that they were legitimate because I have paid for a similar service before from a different company however I actually received direct contact information. Also I assumed that since it was on Trulia then it was ok (that was my fault for assuming). I have also seen them on Zillow so be careful. I wish I would have read Yelp first.

2,"Oh, Westgate Center...\n I live just down the street from this shiny mecca of overpriced, mediocre chains. While I have never attended a sporting event or concert here I do frequent a few of the establishments within this development periodically. If you must eat here I recommend Kabuki (Japanese) or the Yard House (American, upscale pub food with an impressive beer and liquor menu). My boyfriend and I attended the 2011 New Year's Eve event here with a few friends for two reasons: 1)we had just moved here and 2) were too exhausted to do much of anything else. That was a huge mistake! I felt slightly misled as to what we were gaining access to upon paying for admission. Our admission allowed us to only stand in the middle of the common area and listen to a band and pay for a fairly expensive, limited variety of cocktails. All of the bars and restaurants had their own separate cover. Call me crazy, but that seems like a ridiculous business plan. It would have made more sense if they had raised the cover and allowed all of those people to flow freely through the restaurants and bars that Westgate offers. Don't be so stingy Westgate!",270818

I've been jumped on by Yorkies and Pitbulls alike...Cosmos takes all kinds.  Same as any bark park -- watch your dog like a hawk to make sure they're minding their manners and protect them from potentially aggressive dogs with your calm, assertive energy.\n\nThe thing that blows my mind about Cosmos is that people let their kids play there...it's a DOG playground not a CHILD playground.  I was there on Veteran's Day and there were a couple of moms who were letting their babies play in the gravel by the water like it was a day at the shore.  IT IS NOT A REAL BEACH PEOPLE!!!

If it had been that experience alone I would have given them 5 stars but unfortunately it is not. I also ordered a lady gaga cake and this one missed the mark. The fondant it's lumpy and the piping it's extremely uneven. When I called to voice my disappointment the decorator Jay would not have it. He changed the cake was perfect and that if I wanted a specific look I should have agreed for it.  I will post pictures of the cake and what I feel the problem areas are. Sadly, I will find a new cake shop BC of his reaction and the quality.\n\n**UPDATE 8-6-14**\nSomeone from KAK has been harassing me on Yelp sending me messages as to question the validity of my statements. Claiming that I must have left the cake in the sun or that for some reason the quality of the cake is my own fault. Truth is I was unable to confront Jay face to face because I was uncomfortable with that but made sure to call him as soon as I left the store. The cake was kept cool under the AC in my brand new car and at no time had extreme exposure to the AZ heat. Jay had told me that the fondant was still soft because he had just finished the cake, mind you I ordered it nearly a month in advance.

Seemed like undercooked beef fat,all gelatinous. heh heh,gross.\n-never got water refills and I was really thirsty...hubby got offered a soda refill in our last five minutes \n-no mac n cheese bar, french macaroons, mini candied/choc covered apples, or egg-cream-things that night\n\nHere's the pros,hope I don't miss any:\n+I love the individual pots of foods\n+there are automated wine stations, which I'm still not quite sure how to use, some kind of card was needed, which was never offered to me at any time...anyway, there are 8 bottles in there and you can get a full ($10), half($5), or quarter($2) pour of any of them\n+the water comes in big beautiful corked bottles and tastes really good\n+my fav foods: gnocchi with asiago cheese and lamb sauce!!!!, shrimp and grits, white clam pizza (I had 2), truffle potatoes gratin, mac n cheese, THE CHEESE PLATE, arugala salad, mango parfait, passion fruit fudge, fatass choc covered strawberries...so pretty much everything I grabbed was stellar\n+gorgeous scenery\n+Hubby put this at the top of his buffet list\n\nSo even after the given trouble the night before, this place did exceed my expectations. I would most certainly be back,as soon as possible, and I am now having a real hard time deciding who is my top buffet: Wicked spoon, Bellagio buffet, or buffet at M resort. They all have their incredible features, but given the price and value, I may say Wicked Spoon.",492017
4,"Service was A+++ Omar was a great bartender and very attentive. Place was very clean. Food selection was good, would have liked to see a few more options. The tacos that we had were tasty and the salsa selection was very good!!! See you guys again real soon!!!",637571
4,"This is now my go-to Hawaiian place. I have tried the loco moco, the katsu loco moco, the ahi poke furikake style, short ribs, and the kalua pig and cabbage. All are better than what I've had at L&L BBQ or Aloha Kitchen and the portions are triple what you get at the other places. Great Service as well.",372240
2,"Cute place in a good little neighborhood however this was not my favorite breakfast spot . My husband and I stopped by to order omelette and traditional French toast. I was very excited to eat there since I had heard lots of hype about the place. When we got our food I was highly disappointed by the cold potatoes that were given to me. Also, the omelette was meh... Considering all the yummy breakfast options on Melrose, this place is not my first choice.",592527
3,"Not a coffee drinker...but:\n\nI like the space, I like the comfy seating and the plethora of outlets to plug in computers, and of course the free internet. It gets a bit crowded at certain times of day because of its central location.\n\nWhat I do not like: their hot chocolate tastes like Swiss MIss and costs significantly more...",416224
4,"Massive portions of the Greek version of comfort food. It doesn't get much better than Z's for the price and convenience. Great staff, quick service, diner feel. I have had probably 80% of the menu and can't say any of them has been subpar. \n\nI'm here 2x a week for lunch, and my go-to meal is a falafel appetizer and a Greek salad with chicken.",298517
5,great shop...manager Craig is fair and knowledgeable....saved me a bunch of money!!!\nI've had all three of our BMW's in there for service..!\n\nMike,24556
2,"Food was good.  On weekend dinner they have all you can drink wine.  For bottomless wine it was decent, the only problem was that the server only refilled my glass once and I had to ask her to do it.  Service was just meh.\n\nBe warned: if you have the shrimp, you will have to pull off all the crap yourself.  \n\nAmbiance was just OK.  I would go to the Wynn or even the Bellagio before I'd return to this buffet.",392239
4,"Tried Bombay Spice last night. After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts!\n\nIt was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!). \n\n Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations. \n\nWe ordered:\nSomosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty).\nNaan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum)\nGrilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).\n\nWe each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. \n\nI ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).\n\nHusband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home. \n\nNext time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things. \n\n$35 before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. We'll definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us.",320246
4,Went for lunch last week\nService was good\nFood was good\n\nI had a Reuben sandwich\nFriend had fish and chips\n\nReuben was very tasty with good potato salad\nFish and chips had a slab of fish!!!\n\nWe will be back,79587
3,"we are die hard craft steak fans. every trip to vegas is not complete without us going to that restaurant. we were told colicchio's new restaurant, heritage steak, had just opened at the Mirage about a week ago. I really put a lot of time into deciding to go with the old reliable craft steak or trying the new restaurant. Should have gone to craft. \nfirst impression: The place is not as big or up scale as craft. They had plenty of staff but the service was not fluent, ok its a new restaurant and they are working out the kinks. Ordered drinks, took a while, ok we werent there to get drunk so no biggie. ordered the lamb ribs, hamachi, and the ash bone marrow. the hamachi and the ribs were phenomenal, the bone marrow (to my disappointment) was undercooked and didnt come with any toast so eating it was a bit weird. Ordered the tabasco peppered kobe skirt and my wife had the spice roasted lobster. The steak was ok at best, definitely not the same kobe skirt that they have at craft. The lobster was overcooked in my opinion and a bit tough to chew. For desert, we had mascarpone panna cotta which was very nice and tasty. oh yeah, and they were so nice to bring us a small bunt cake looking thing since I had notated in my reservation that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary. I am sorry, but if spending $300 per couple for dinner doesnt constitute a decent desert, then dont bother bringing me a dry little cake with a candle on it. overall, did not measure to the expectations, thought the menu wasnt impressive, lacked raw seafood and not a huge selection of steaks to choose from, etc. There are too many better steak houses in vegas for me to try heritage again, sorry Tom.",616433
5,I've been back twice since I wrote this review.  Same great food; same great music.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.,144976
4,"I visited the lounge midweek  and have to admit I enjoyed myself. It wasn't a place that was over the top, but if you are able to visit its a good stop. I enjoyed the DJ providing a great blend of all party genres. The place provided enough room to dance and the drinks were strong. The one issue is theirs a lot of drunk people in the club also. The staff enjoys themselves which adds to the awesome club/lounge atmosphere.",615164
2,"Eh...  \n\nMaybe this place is just too sophisticated for my palate.\n\nHubby and I came here for lunch last Monday.  I ordered the Shabu style Hot and Sour soup with tofu, and hubby ordered the sugar cane pork spare ribs and chili lime beef.\n\nThe soup was alright, but not very substantial.  It came with a variety of vegetables, some japanese vegetable I cannot even begin to spell, mushrooms, baby corn, and tomatoes.  I must admit, the hot house tomatoes sort of threw me off.  Because it said Shabu style, i had envisioned something more, more noodles and tofu for dipping perhaps?  Anyway, I definitely would not order that dish again.\n\nThe chili lime beef was actually a beef carpaccio, more lime than chili.  Not that I have anything against carpaccio, but there was nothing on the menu to indicate it would be carpaccio style, and I feel like that is something you should disclose.  \n\nThe sugar cane pork definitely stole the show.  They were tangy and sweet, and extremely tasty.  However one winner out of three just isn't enough to make me want to come back.",351500
5,"Great food, service, and atmosphere! The staff loves kids! I recommend the chicken burger on pretzel bun and the beer-b-que wings!",617256
3,"I needed to get some new dish towels and I decided to check here.  They had a fairly good selection but the prices were Triple B prices--too much.\n\nI walked around the store and looked at the other items they had.  You never know.  The store is about the same as it was when it first opened and I was getting things for our house.\n\nAfter a quick look around the store, I left and got some nice towels elsewhere at a reasonable price.\n\nI've always found the employees to be quite pleasant.",147985
1,"I've given this place a try on 3 different occasions since it seems to get such great reviews.  The first time  I went, I ordered the tenderloin, medium cooked.  They overcooked the steak the first shot, so I sent it back.  The second shot was WAY undercooked, but I didn't send it back again.\n\nThe second time I went for lunch, I ordered the steak sandwich.  I ordered it medium, yet once again it was undercooked.  I didn't send it back because the people I was with kept on telling me how good a restaurant it was, and so I didn't send it back because I didn't want them to look bad..  So instead, I choked down my undercooked steak sandwich.\n\nThis last time I ordered the scallops.  They did not taste fresh at all.  Over $30 for 3 fishy tasting scallops????\n\nThis place has a stuffy atmosphere and horrible food.  I will never go back.",219432
4,"The thing about the Cosmopolitan is that its so modern and hip and chic, its a little intimidating for those of us who only know about Kim Kardashian because ESPN tells us about the athlete she's banging and are not actively pursuing her kind of lifestyle.  However, I found it to be far more approachable than I expected it to be, especially during the day.\n\nThe people working there were very friendly, the restaurants are top notch, and the place is just flat out beautiful.  It doesn't hurt that the Cosmopolitan is a magnet for gorgeous women, the kind who think of Kim Kardashian as a role model, and hell I don't mind looking.",435740
2,What a joke!   Their food is good. But the service I just had for lunch was atrocious.   Ordered my food with an iced tea.    Received the ice tea at the bar and then had to ask the bartender for sweetener.    As I looked around the place was nearly empty.   The bartender walks away and I don't see him for another 5 minutes or so.     My iced tea was empty after two minutes and when I looked around for someone to give a refill.   Surprise.  No one is around.    I had to wait until my food arrived from it looked like a cook to get a refill from someone other than the bartender.   Of course with no ice in it.    Nice room temperature to it.   He also had to get me silverware. \nFrankly I was less than impressed with the service.    It wasn't until halfway done with my meal that the bartender comes by with a cup of ice and a spoon to tell me. The ice melts fast.    Gee.  I think it really melts fast when their is no ice in the refill cup too.   \n\nI am only giving two stars for the food which I believe is 4+ stars.   I am going to stick with delivery and takeout.    If you want to get better service go next door to the Persian restaurant.   They at least check on their patrons.,242483
3,"Heart Attack Grill is a hamburger joint with a zany parallel universe hospital theme.  Waitresses dress in somewhat provocative nurse outfits (The type of nurse outfits you'll see in fantasy playbacks in movies with everything all boosted up and sticking out).  Following the theme, each customer is required to wear hospital gowns upon entrance.  Their burger is eloquently named the \""bypass\"" and depending on the number of patties it'll be the single, double, triple, quadruple (more if you'd like...) \""bypass\"".  \n\nWhen a place is called heart attack anything, it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question.  Parodied movie posters are plastered all over the walls.  While I'm no Jason Bourne, I always do a scan of any place I go too before settling in my seat.  Here my sights stopped on a rather large scale.  Above the scale was an indicator pronouncing whoever weighs 350 lbs, WILL EAT FREE!  First off, if you weigh that much, eating here may be hazardous to your health.  I was lucky enough to see a fellow customer climb onto that scale and \""win\"" a free meal.  Sirens went off with applause following.  \n\nA close buddy from L.A. had been talking about trying this place out on a couple occasions.  The three of us looking at menus in hospital gowns was a sight to see.  After a couple chuckles we ordered.  The smallest of the group ended up ordering the triple bypass while I chickened out and got the double.  We all shared a side of chili cheese fries which could have fed five or more easily.  Sizes are massive and while I did finish most of it; I don't think it was a particularly good idea.  Splicing chili on top of each burger patty inserted another layer of taste to a burger that consisted mainly of overly greasy meat flavor.  Take out the notion I was clogging my arteries at an exponential rate after each bite, the burger was ok.    \n\nThe novelty of it all is an experience in itself.  Seeing a couple Japanese tourists being spanked by the nurse waitresses is another interesting sight.  Rule is if you don't finish, you get spanked.  I'm assuming this was optional since any normal human would assuredly have trouble finishing these burgers and not everyone got spanked.  Aligning their extreme gimmick with the same motto of a more adult Hooter's equating to more show than emphasis on food, Heart Attack Grill is worth at least ONE visit.  I don't know about a second.  My heart may not be able to handle it.",530519
2,This place is simply confusing! And not in a good way. It's a nice place but it does not define itself at all. The menu includes breakfasr items but no lunch items and it does not have typical bar food either. No chicken wings yet there are tvs all over the place setting up the place to be a typical bar. It tries to be a wine bar but the wine list is very limited. We ordered the ordinary nachos which were decent and I also had the grilled  chicken sandwich which I ended up just eating the  chicken breast.  we went on a weekday so it might be different on the weekend but if u want a wine bar or a regular bar or a place to have a nice meal there are better options. the owners need to figure out what their concept is because it just left us confused and frustrated.,447201
5,We were there for our companies dinner & the let me tell you I am not a meat lover but I had fillet minon & it was mouthwatering amazing! The ambiance in the red was very beautiful & the cheesecake was extremely good!!! The service was with outermost respect & all the waiters were very polite!!! Just an amazing experience overall!!!,296550

2,"After decades of hearing about Carolina's we stopped by. I don't understand what the fuss is all about. If I was in the neighborhood and wanted some Mexican food I would stop in. But it is not worth any kind of drive. There are a hundred Mexican joints in the valley as good or better. I had the flauta special. Nothing special there. Three run of the mill flautas, a quarter cup of beans and a quarter cup of rice. The beans were ok the rice was not worth putting in your mouth. Plus you get to eat off of styrofoam to go boxes. The bean and cheese burro was run of the mill fast food Mexican. The only good thing I can say is the tortillas were above average. We bought a dozen to take home.",28563
3,"Honestly I wasn't impressed. I've been to fantastic sushi restaurants including Nobu in NYC, so maybe I have high standards, but the way I like sushi is when you actually can be impressed by the quality of the fish. Unfortunately, the specialty rolls that Cyros offers seems to cover up the taste of the fish. Their most popular roll, the Cyros Avante Garde, had fried shallots and garlic on top...way too much garlic flavor for sushi. I will say the service is friendly and they have a good selection of sake. Other than that, the atmosphere is not so great...head to Roosters next door for a better atmosphere. Otherwise if you're looking for sushi that actually tastes like sushi, head over to Yama or Ru San's.",426035
4,"We were seated right away around noon on a Sunday, the service was fast and concise, and the food came fast. There was not a huge selection of carts, but almost everything we had was up to dim sum standards and great. The shrimp balls were excellent, and the \""deep fried dumplings\"" were amazing--we think they had pork in them, but either way they were great. Definitely easy, delicious, and very typical for dim sum. We will definitely go there again, but it wasn't quite as good as our Chinatown place we used to go to in Atlanta.",123792
4,"Excellent Food!!! Great views from the outdoor terrace and interior has many tables close enough to get great views, only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was lack of staff, but our waiter was very good! Definitely want to try this place :)",55849
4,"So I really wanted to Yelp something today. So, a buddy (@groovypucks) and I went to Thai Lahna.  I noticed it had a LOT of reviews and still maintained a pretty reputable score!  Hey, its only a block or two from work, so why not?\n\nWe get there and are immediately seated which in my opinion is rare.  For the rave reviews, I noticed it was kind of 'dead' for a lunch crowd.  A few old people and the owners were all I really noticed.  We get a booth seat (I love booth seats.  If I could work, sleep and eat in a booth seat, I would die a happy man) so I am already getting excited.  Groovypucks and I take way too long looking at the menu and finally decide on our dishes (which we accompanied with a Thai Tea).  I asked to make my curry spicy(#36 Yellow Curry Chicken with Green Beans), and it WAS!  Almost too spicy, but I attribute that to my lack of experience with their dishes.  If I were to order it again, I would order it medium.\n\nGroovy got a Peanut and Chicken dish (#35) with onions and peppers.  I tried a bit, as I am comfortable in my sexuality, and I really liked it.  It was Damn good! That's right, Capital D!  The service for the rest of the meal was below par, but not to the point that it was annoying.  It just took a little too long to get my food and my check at the end...\n\n...And with this review I leave you with my fortune\n\nIf strength were all,\ntiger would not fear scorpion.",24280
3,The Panda Express of Filipino fast food. I been coming here since high school. they have more selections than the comparable Filipino restaurants around. I love coming here for breakfast because everything is fresh! I just wish they renovate the place or maintain it. Food is good but I'm just skeptic about what goes on in the back and overall cleanliness of the place. I'm from the Philippines tho so I don't mind much but for American standards it's something to think about.,306119
