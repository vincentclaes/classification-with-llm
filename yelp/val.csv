1,Stumbled across this restaurant with a friend visiting in and decided to take a chance with it and do I regret making that choice.\n\nWhen we went in it looked busy and took a while for them to stay us but then we were led into the other dining area which was nearly empty (only about three or for people exited from here when we entered). \n\nI ordered the chicken pad Thai and all three of us got a mango smoothie. When the food came my chicken in the pad Thai was tough and dry although the noodles were okay. When or drinks came they gave my friend a cup that was filled 75% compared to mine. When my friend complained they said it was because it was all that was left in the blender after pouring the previous two. Could they not have bothered to put in the effort to make a bit more so it didn't look as bad? It really wasn't that busy.... Service was bad to begin with as well and slow. \n\nNerve coming here again.\n\nOverall two stars both for service and quality of food.,518429
2,If you are looking for fast and cheap then this is your place. Full set of acrylics with pedi and brow wax for $90. The place is small old and loud. The TVs don't pick up the Satellite channels very well. \n\nThree star rating due it looking dirty with nail clippings from acrylics on the floor. And the place needs a coat of paint.,50647
1,"Been here a couple times and really want to love it ....but just can't.  \n\nLunch this week was just okay.  Our server Jill was very enthusiastic and efficient.  For some reason this place is noisy in a very annoying way.  We endured clinking, clacking and other such kitchen/bar distractions during most of our meal.  Try having a conversation!  \n\nWe ordered meatloaf sliders w/ fries (I know, at an Asian place no less!) and pad thai.  The sliders were okay but at $11.95 not a value.  Pad thai lunch-portion was $7.95 - a bowl of noodles w/ some chicken & shrimp and a few onions & shredded carrots.  I guess next time I want \""Asian\"" I'll go all the way to a Real Chinese restaurant.\n\nOn the upside, I counted 7 different kinds of sake on the menu.  If you're a sake drinker, maybe this makes up for the so-so food?",312953
2,not bad. i like that you can order online and set up the time you want to pick up your food. i had the thai coconut curry and pot stickers. the food was good. obviously its not the most authentic but do you really expect authentic at a place like this? not really. all in all i'm a fan. i'll be back.,247583
3,"Second stay at Trump Tower. Loved the hotel both times - great place for a lady traveling. Room large, free coffee and water in the room, free internet, bathroom with a tv in the mirror (hey, I watched tv while drying my hair - that's luxury!). Only thing missing was a robe - and I thought they provided robes in the room to borrow? Maybe I dreamed that?\n\nHad a late flight and since I had to check out of my room hung out in the bar area. Had snacks to eat and since it was happy hour had a couple glasses of red wine. Still got my free internet so I could wrap up business and not be days behind when I got back home. Waiter very polite, kept my water glass full, and brought me food and wine in a timely manner. Great way to end my business trip.\n\nSituation at the bar - couple had a loud and rambunctious child. After some time the hostess finally asked them to move so the rest of us grownups could enjoy ourselves. I really appreciated her taking are of this situation.",318845
2,"I enjoyed the Paris, but I find it to be quite overpriced.  I would easily give it 4 stars if it were less for the cost.  \n\nThe rooms were pretty standard, but the real star of Paris is the buffett.  The gaming floor is also large and easy to navigate.",161547
2,Great breakfast and great staff! Had the Bird omelet and it was chock full of Turkey and avocados.  Great experience.,100757
0,"I came to test-drive a car and all of the questions I asked the salesman read the answers directly off the sticker. Since I am a literate person, that wasn't necessary nor was it relevant as the questions I had about the vehicle didn't have answers that could have been found on the sticker. Yeah, I do my own research before I waltz into these places and when I ask questions I expect my \""expert\"" sales guy to answer them as he is supposed to know what he's selling, right?\nI had to leave. \nThe next day, Salesguy Einstein called me. And then a few days later. And again, a few days after that. I'll give him that for at least being persistent. But he thought the price was the problem - not the car itself, which I decided I didn't like anymore after I drove it, and he was leaving me these ridiculous messages about selling me a \""used Mercedes.\"" It was all really annoying and embarrassing to listen to.",548439
0,"My husband and I walked in about 8:30 on a Wednesday night and asked for a table for 2.  The hostess was completely thrown that we had just walked in and didn't have a reservation.  As in, she really didn't know what to do.  As she sat there looking confused and looking around the restaurant, my husband suggested that we could grab a drink at the bar while she figured it out.  She looked relieved and went off to talk to a gentleman who worked there (we presumed about our seating).  \n\nMeanwhile husband ordered a martini, and I a glass of $18 wine.  At least it was a big pour.  The wine list was out of control expensive without being out of control excellent.  My baseline is Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label - in the local wine stores here, I can buy it retail for $35-40/bottle.  On this menu, it was $125.  After having a tremendous bottle of Rioja the night before at Stripsteak (at $85) that we were still reminiscing about while at the bar, we decided that by the glass was probably the best way to go.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we determined that our previous night's meal was so good, that neither of us would be opposed to going back if we weren't going to be seated by the end our our drinks.  Ten minutes later, husband paid the bar tab, the hostess was nowhere to be seen, and we took off for another delicious steak down the strip.",198291

4,"I visited Jobing.com for the Kiss concert earlier this week. I previously visited a few years ago when the Dancing with the Stars tour came to town. The arena is very clean, I found parking to be a breeze and the staff great. Some coworkers told me to expect $20 for parking. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was no charge. My friend and I arrived early and had time to go to the Yardhouse close by. Having neighboring food and drink establishments close by helps save money on the inside. \n\nMy seats to the show were on the floor and ushers showed us the way. Although the tickets said no camera allowed, fans had cameras and cell phones. Security allowed people to walk to the stage with their camera, while the band members walked over and posed while playing. As long as fans stayed for only a couple of minutes and were orderly, security approved. The seats were good, the atmosphere great and it was maybe the best show I have ever seen.\n\nI found getting out of the arena was good. Police guided the way, directed traffic with a descent flow and it was a quick drive to the highway. Great night and an enjoyable venue!",116085
4,We have used Top Notch Transportation for our company party the last few years and they have been great every year. We have 20-30 people from all over the city and they are able to coordinate rides so that everyone arrives to the party on time. Definitely will keep using them for future events.,422475
4,"The food was great! I had the Blackened Salmon it was delicious very moist.\nI also had the Alpine Village soup I am a local,  and the soup was good but I didn't think it taste like Alpine Village, I love the Broads with the old Vegas look very nice touch as well as the live piano !! Defiantly recommend",536161
2,"Mmmmm.  Popcorn.  Many, many flavors of popcorn.  Sweet, savory.  Chocolate, nuts.  Buttery, salty.  All of it.  And MPK does it well.  I love that they offer mini bags ranging from $2-$6.  Forced portion control.  If I was given a barrel of popcorn, I would somehow manage to get it down.\n\nSo why only 3 stars?  Less than impressive customer service.  Now the lady at the front (owner?) is great.  Very helpful and friendly.  The girls in the back...not so great.  I was in before Christmas to buy 13 mini bags...all different.  Although there were numerous people in the back, there seemed to be more socializing than actual work going on.  It took a good 20 minutes or so to get my order ready.  I could have eaten the product faster than they packed it.  No worries.  The shop is fun to browse.  But when my order was finally ready and I was heading out the door, an employee came out with a bag that they had missed.  At this point, I knew they probably did not bother to double check my order, so I did it when I got to my car.  Even with the bag they missed, I was still missing one...a $6 bag at that.\n\nAgain, the lady at the front was very apologetic, but the gal working in the back was argumentative as she \""knew\"" she had packed that particular flavor.  She came out front to get my entire bag, so that she could go through it herself and see what was missed.  Apparently, I am both a liar, illiterate, and unable to count to 13.  So now I'm waiting again with nothing to do but wonder why they didn't do this before they gave me the order.  Finally, she was sufficiently convinced the missing bag was, indeed, missing.  Upon returning my order, she remarked it had been packed, but not given to me.\n\nI still might not have dropped my rating if not for the fact that while I was waiting for the sleuth in the back to solve her case, another customer came in complaining that she was missing 5 bags of her 20 bag order.  Unfortunately for her, the order was for an office function that had already taken place.\n\nSo moral of my long-winded review is to give MPK a shot if you're a popcorn lover, but make sure you check your order before you leave.  They won't.",563189
2,"My boyfriend and I came here over the weekend while we were in town for Spring Training. \n\nWe arrived around 8 pm and it was about 40% full on a Thursday night. They had a cover band playing at a reasonable volume but there is no ambiance music playing when the band takes a break so it does get a little eerily quiet.\n\n It's \""family style\"" seating. So you could be sharing your large table with others. They do have a bar top which you can sit at, and a patio with heaters.\n\nOur server seemed a little lost or new and would disappear at times. We asked for samples of a few of their beers and she gave us the wrong ones. We decided to get the Soiled Dove Dirty Blonde Ale and another one I can't remember. Both were just ok.\n\nAppetizer - we ordered the Lumpia which are little \""spring rolls\"" with pork, veggies and a really good peanut sauce. I believe 8 came with the order. $7\n\nMain Course - North Mountain Burger w/ fries $14  and Fish and Chips $12. The  Fish and Chips didn't taste like they had been sitting in a freezer forever. The tarter sauce wasn't your normal tarter sauce but it was delicious - hints of mustard in it. The food came out quickly and hot. Nothing to rave about but it was good.\n\nI would come here again if it was on my way to my destination or near me, definitely wouldn't seek this place out as my first choice.",596541
3,Go here for your Hawaiian food / filipino fix!  I always get the Adobo Omlett!! so good...but i have had Chicken Katsu from here and other food.  Def  a must if you are sick from the vegas buffets.,144115
4,Very aesthetically pleasing atmosphere and the bowls and smoothies are delicious. I got the PB bowl and it was awesome! And it was healthy as well. Recommend to give this place a try,635146
4,"Let me start out by saying, I share food when it's good but I DON'T share food when it's REAAAAAALY good! So I was there with a friend enjoying their fantastic potato salad and she had scarfed hers down in like 5 seconds and her fork was headed towards mine. I stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled NO! And just think, this is JUST the potato salad from here! \n\nThe burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever! I stick with the cheeseburger because I want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it. I literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side. Ok, I know that sounds dirty...but it was SO good!! I haven't strayed much from the burgers, but I did have the tuna melt once and it was good, but nothing compares to the burgers. I mean, that's what you go there for! Plus, my friend saw Russell Crowe there while he was filming a movie in the burgh, so you have to know it's good if his peeps recommended he go there!",3507
4,"This is a must-see if you are visiting Pittsburgh. The architecture inside is amazing, and in the winter time they even light the huge fireplaces on the first floor. Give yourself some time to check out all of the Nationality Rooms as well. Pitt has a wireless network in the building, so a lot of students hide away and study there (or just procrastinate by web surfing). \n\nSecret tip - take the elevators to the 35th/36th floor - the view is fantastic!",184957
4,The Service Manager Keith contacted me and worked directly with me.  He was understanding and acknowledged the concerns.  He took in my car and worked to make the corrections.  My car is fixed and no longer has alignment issues.  Definitely satisfied with their response and I will stay a customer.,447917
2,"On my most recent and likely last (for awhile) Vegas trip, my intentions were to eat at some top-notch restaurants...We stayed at the Hard Rock and headed to Nobu...\n\nNobu was on a Friday night about 8:30pm after being at the Ditch Day Pool Party at the Palms all day...needless to say we were hungry!\n\nVery vibrant atmosphere and great for a starter to the nights activities...\n\nOur first try was the Washu Beef tataki style which we ordered rare...FABULOUS!!\n\nThen onto the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (whoever was the first to pair these two is a genius) you can never go wrong with yellow-tail\n\nRolls and Sushi were fresh and good...the restaurant was packed and I can see why...would definitely go again",162235
1,"First of all, like everyone else, I've wanted to try this place. I've heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. \n\nI arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), \""We don't seat parties if they aren't all here, but you can check if they're in there.\"" Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. \n\nFirst of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer's platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there's a difference between good and thinking something's good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. \n\nSecond, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I've had better service when Binion's Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. \n\nThird, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you're practically sitting on their neighbor's lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don't get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. \n\nFourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she \""LOST\"" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would've picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I'm not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn't be that rude to anyone! \n\nI give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it's worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We'll see...\n\nSo Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to  pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn't  running around forgetting people's orders, losing people's credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer's platters can pay a waiter's 4 hour shift and they'd provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!",427128
4,"A little hard to find but worth the effort.  Hint, its right behind the sleepy poet antique mall.  They have pretty much all the average home brewer would need.  Plus, knowledgeable people to help.  I hear they also have a warehouse in Belmont and can order pretty much anything else.  Highly recommned.",83512
2,"What a treat!  This Western themed restaurant is as hokey as it gets.  We went to Rustler's Rooste for a rehearsal dinner and the set-up outside was pretty cool with city views.  Between the rattlesnake appetizers, fried shrimp, bbq chicken and the many libations, we had good time.  The food was only mediocre, but the service was good and the tourist nature of the spot was entertaining.\n\nOne plus for the family folks is that kids...LOTS of kids are welcome.  There is a fenced-in bull when you walk in and a slide with lots of screaming kiddos.  The prices are a little steep for the quality but it is a tourist trap, so be prepared.",31804
3,"I love finding a good hole in the wall restaurant.  The food was excellent and so was the service.  Complimentary garlic bread and two carafes of wine was a plus.  I had the chicken rio which I highly recommend.  \n\nOverall, a great fun experience.  Will definitely return when I'm back in Las Vegas, NV.",131392
2,"I have pretty much come to the conclusion that these wings are the fast food of wings. Not that they try to present themselves otherwise but I just get a very generic feel from these wings.\n\nI will say that the service at this location is top notch. The cashier taking orders was very nice and made sure to clarify what I had ordered before she put the order in. I ordered three chicken strips with original hot sauce and fries with a side of cheese sauce. The strips were just okay. I would not go out of my way to order them again. The fries were the same. The cheese sauce that came with them was overall pretty bland. My true issue lies with the amount of salt that is used in everything here. Way too much salt. It became overpowering halfway through my meal. As one of the other reviewers said, I could also taste sugar in the fries which is just completely unnecessary. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back to Wing Stop. There are certainly many other better alternatives for wings in the area. I might consider trying something else here but not any time soon.",627349

0,"Can I give negative stars? \nMy boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said \""here's your check please pay and leave.\"" I said \""Excuse me\"" and he responded \""You are a waste of space at my bar.\"" I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded \""are you serious?\"" All he said was \""Leave\"" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, \""Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway.\"" As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said \""I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!\"" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out? Very questionable service to me.",105616
3,"This is a nice park.  A bit set away from the happening strip.  Taxi fare if you don't have a car is maybe $30-$40 to the Mirage area. I stayed with friends and would have wanted to let them relax at the park while I went back to the strip, but with the cost, I passed.  They have a general store that had the basic's, however no Beer or wine sold.  They have 2 pools one for Adults and one for Families. I don't know if the Europeans could read the signs as there was a couple of instances where they would bring in their kids to the adult pool.  The bathrooms were clean with and each individual suite had the bathroom and shower.  The dog park was nice for those with canines.  If you have dogs, you might want to ask for a space close to that.  Also some spaces have tree's that might restrict your use of your awning.",259315

0,"I am really disappointed in this place, but they are just around the corner and we keep hoping. HAHAHA! This time is the last! They just keep getting worse and worse. The selection is pathetic unless you get there immediately after they cook their donuts. Which appears to be once a day, some time in the morning. Otherwise, they're not fresh. To boot, they insist a bear claw is some kind of apple-filled monstrosity. In addition to the numerous times we have gotten what were supposed to be filled donuts and they had only a DOT of filling, the latest is donuts that they can't even bother cooking all the way. They tasted like wet dough  because they WERE WET DOUGH! These people are nice enough but they seem to not give a damn that the quality is TERRIBLE!

The staff was friendly and accommodating despite the fact that we had made our appointments just that morning.\n\nAbout my wax:\nI had a Brazilian wax and my \""waxpert\"" was Carla. I had been having trouble with ingrown hairs so she spent the first few minutes explaining about the different types of wax (they offer hard and soft w/strips) and learning about my hair and skin. Throughout the wax she talked me through and was very nice, like talking to a friend. They are very hygienic here, no double dipping! After the wax Carla went to great lengths to tweeze the ingrown hairs as well as recommend products (they have their own line).

2,"Some of the BBQ was great!  But some of the lines were so long that getting up to the booth was almost impossible. There were many booths that we didn't try, because we couldn't get near them. Even the lines to get food and drink tickets were long. Not enough volunteers?\n\nFood and drink tickets were $2 - and a few places had samples for $2. That's what we were looking for - samples to try as many different  local BBQ places as we could. But many places had only full meals or sandwiches. We could have just gone to a BBQ restaurant anywhere in town and had a nice cool sit-down BBQ meal. But that wasn't the point. \n\nThe point was to try what AZ has to offer in the way of BBQ. \n\nAlso, someone needs to tell the vendors that next year they should have a sign up in the back of their tent giving their storefront location. When we tried something we liked, we had to inquire as to where they were located in town. \n\nMarketing folks! Marketing! Especially if you want folks to find your restaurant.\n\nAlso, whomever came up with the idea of stand in this line to order and move over to that line to pick-up must have not been using their noodles. Even fast food joints make you show a receipt or ticket that you have paid. If you were standing in the pick-up line here you got food. \n\nNo questions asked. Not a good business model . . . even for one day.\n\nIs this an annual event? Well, if so, someone needs to work on the logistics before next year.  A lot could be done to make this an event that really shows off the valley BBQ community. It kind of had the feeling of being thrown together at the last minute. Was it?\n\nNeeded more shade. Needed more places to sit and eat. The band needed shade. This is AZ folks. The sun is hot.\n\nOh, yeah, parking was free and seemed to be very well organized!",558581
4,"We bought an Amazon voucher for $99 that gave us 1/4 of a truck (supposedly a $247 value). We had a large pile of bricks, old cement blocks, tree limbs, bags of shingles, sticks, and other random yard refuse. We called and they quickly got us an appointment for the next day. They (Matt & Chris) showed up exactly on time and reviewed our pile and said they could take care of it for an additional $100 on top of our voucher. This was fine with us, as for $199 total cost they would do the hauling and loading of all that for us whereas our other only option was to get a dumpster for about $240 and do it ourselves. Anyhow, they were very friendly and got to work, constantly providing updates. Unfortunately, as they moved down the pile they ran into a bee nest, and one of them was allergic. However, they very kindly proceeded forward and just avoided the main bee area (note to others, inspect and SPRAY before these guys arrive). Anyhow, our load definitely took much more than 1/4 of the truck and they felt they had underestimated a little and didn't realize the number of bricks on the bottom of the pile, so we both agreed to up the final price to $150 additional on top of the voucher. So, this ended up being about the same cost to us, but we didn't do any of the work. Gave them each $10 for their help and hard work, and our yard is almost back to looking good (except the little pile still remaining for us to do Bee Battle with).\n\nOverall, these are good folks and provide you an estimate up front, so we were pleased.",566619
3,What a great location for Happy Hour when it isn't searing hot to sit on the patio. Sunday brunch is pretty fab here too since they used to have bottomless mimosa's. Try the Ahi taco's for Happy Hour!  The staff is pretty attentive once you get a table but it rubs me the wrong way when high school hostesses act as if you are an inconvenience or pretending they work at a club,447123

4,I'm from Atlanta visiting at a convention downtown and tried this place as a recommendation. The food was outstanding and the service was excellent.  Worth the short drive to sit outside in the pleasant weather this time of year.  Would definitely recommend.,319222
2,"I'm not a gourmet coffee fan.  For the most part I think gourmet tastes like dirt, or is way to strong.  With that said the coffee here was pretty good.  It was a bit annoying asking for a coffee and having to look at the board as to which one I wanted.  The house blend was nice though.  The place is cozy looking.  The staff was friendly.",2817
2,"I have to agree with the other yelpers. I am a huge carnitas fan and the carnitas here are really good. They come with good basic rice and beans and fresh homemade tortillas, and the guacamole is fresh made and tasty. I really liked the chips, salsa, and the bean dip served at the beginning. The shredded beef tacos are good too.\n\nSome of the other things are a miss....the chimichangas are bad...from the shrimp and the chicken they are just bland.\n\nService is good and our server pepe was great.\n\nI would go again...although I think san francisco has better mexican food.",305093
0,"I was completely disappointed in the quality of the food.  I work downtown and my office mates and I order from Eat quite regularly, but today we were shocked to have received some of the worst food we've ever eaten from Eat.  We ordered both of the chicken sandwiches that are on the limited menu only to discover they were obviously made from frozen chicken breasts that were rubbery and tasted like plastic.  The bread was soggy which, when combined with the disgusting chicken made our sandwiches inedible.  My co worker and I ended up throwing both of our lunches away.  We were also told they no longer are making beignets, which we came to really enjoy.  We vowed never to order from this place again as the food definitely does not match the prices charged, and as there are so many other lunch spots to pick from, we won't miss this eatery.",569232
0,"\""AY. F'ING. CARAMBA. How can a dealer get 21 so many times!!!\"" Those were my exact thoughts about 4 shoes into the $5 black jack table at O'Sheas. Right around the time when I was reevaluating why I ever stepped foot into this tiny, cramped, stuffy joint instead of seeking out a giant alcoholic beverage.\n\nI know this sounds riidiculous but I swear the black jack here is rigged! 4-5 shoes and NO ONE at the completely full table was hitting any ounce of a winning streak. The dealer was hitting black jack, 21, and 20 like nobody's business. I swear it's something with that automatic shuffling device they got goin' on there! I'm on to you O'Sheas!\n\nAfter losing about 2 years of my life in extra-stuffy second hand smoke, and one very crappy daquiri later, I decided enough was enough and left this place about 40 bucks in the hole. Yeah, not a big deal but this experience seriously sucked. I never missed my hotel's beautiful and well ventilated casino so much until I gambled here. UGH. It gets one star for the legit band that was playing, that's it!",629700
3,"This place was really good! Located in the Quad, the portion sizes were huge and the food was really good.  Our server was also attentive and helpful.  The chicken of the chicken and waffles was delicious.  I can't go the full 5 only because I found the waffles to be a little bland.  I was a little envious of the giant pancake at the table next to us. Overall, a ton of food for the price, especially by Vegas standards, and a fun menu for a place that focuses mostly on breakfast.",427503
0,"Terrible service, i went here to only get a flat tire replaced. They said i needed new brakes so I said ok lets change them. I told the manager or the person helping me at the front desk that i was in a rush and wanted to order the brakes and come back. They basically had me sit in the waiting room for an hour before i came out to see what was going on. They spent an hour putting my rim on the WRONG size tire. When i told him that i needed to leave he said ok we will put your tires back on and let you leave. I reminded him i had a flat tire and was riding on a spare. The whole reason i came to them was to get one tire fixed and they made me wait an hour just to screw it all up. Worst care service i have ever gotten hands down",439357
3,"I almost forgot this was the place that had those flavor flav wings lol. so when I came in and ordered my calzone for around $7 i was expecting something way below standard. come on they had flavor flavs wings he's one funky character and a cheesy sign for 99 cent wings i wrote them off before trying them. \n\nIt's probably been a while since they had that sign and the experiment with flavor flavs wings so I gave them a shot. Located in the same center as Bachi Burger but way on the other side. Its a pretty small, clean pizzeria, holds about 10 people maybe more, with a flat screen and some happy pics of who is probably Mama Cimino on one wall and a mural on another wall. \n\nMy sausage calzone was larger then any other I've had a nice size and hot right out of the oven. Enough for tomorrow's lunch or tonight's snack. Came with some marinara sauce on the side, which was a little watery so just mixed in some parmesan and it was fine for me, some made from scratch ranch dressing not the processed stuff. I would have taken a pic but I was starving and already ate some of it. Order in advance because it took at least 20 mins. \n\nThey make Chicago style deep dish pizza, which is my favorite type of pizza so I'll probably come back for that, and the NY style pizza, their largest was huge I forget the measurements but it was only around $17. they have a good menu, calzones, strombolis, sandwiches, pizzas, wings, and at some decent prices. i think they also have some 5 and 10 foot long sandwiches. get back to you on that. \n\nSome of their by slice pizzas during lunch were old and dried up. so hopefully you catch it when it's fresh and right out of the oven.\n\nIf you like them on facebook you get 15% off.",384537

1,"Food was excellent. Price is high but not overpriced. Presentation was outstanding. \n\nWines were in fact overpriced. A restaurant of this quality should know better than to serve a bottle of wine that Harris Teeter carries for 20 and try and sell for 45. A bottle of Merlot for 40??? It's merlot! Come on guys get your act together!\n\nService was very good once we we actually waited on. 7 minutes from the time we sat down. There were only 2 tables in the place that had customers. No excuse for that! \nThe decor was great, the only complaint would be the floors were so sick my chair was constantly sliding thought the night. Very odd that a place would miss out on a detail like that. \n\n\nOverall for $100 for 2 there are too many other choices in Charlotte.",537602
1,"The food was good but OVERPRICED.  The setup was exactly like the old spot.  I thought the old location forced them into a cramped space but apparently,  they like it that way.  Service was good.  The $12 specialty margaritas DID NOT produce a buzz and I COULD NOT taste the tequila. Yes, I SAID IT, 12 DOLLARS!!  (Pint size with ice)  I guess if i order a $12 drink, I expect to taste some liquor in it and it should probably come in a giant margarita glass, like at Arriba's.  I think that the owners are cheap and trying to lure a snooty crowd that likes to show their friends how to properly waste some perfectly good money!!!  I had been to the old location several times.  Won't find me coming back to the new location though.  You've failed to retain an old customer.  Oh,  and the valet parking is just irritating. I walked out and there's my car, parked 20 feet away, and I gotta wait for the guy to get it for me?  All those blue cones are enough to piss ya off!!  What other place in Phoenix is like this?  I had a hard time finding my way out!!",447408
2,"First dinner in Montreal and hotel concierge recommended.\n\nA very nice and elegant decor, a bit upscale but not too over the top.\n\nYou felt they honored great service.  The sushi on the menu seemed pretty normal to me but a bit on the pricey side for what you are ordering....presentation is their strength and we were very pleased with that.  \n\nThe sizzling Black Cod was amazing and a generous portion.  \n\nSushi for two with two glasses of wine, $89.  It hit the spot though.",337607
1,"Originally, I was in love with this place. I have lived here going on my 5th month. In the beginning, they were generous and extremely satisfactory. Now that I've actually been through hell with them, my opinion has completely changed. When they went to go deposit a check I had written to them, they ended up getting all screwed up in the office and deposited two checks (one post-dated for a few weeks following) - This withdrew my account and I ended up speaking to the property manager and everything seemed handled, right? I think not. I go in to pay my rent and its an extra $70+ dollars added to my account. MY question -Why?! According to the property manager, who of course just had to intervene, the account charges were only covered to a point... SO, you're trying to tell me that because of your mistake I have to pay EVEN MORE? Excuse me, but that is not my error nor am I at fault. Then, she had the nerve to tell me to \""check\"" my attitude - all the while she was giving me attitude. WELL, if that is the way you want to treat your residents who can, for example, just go and log onto Yelp! and write of all the horrid experiences they have, they go right on ahead. The secondary problem I have with this place is that I was sent a check in the mail to cover my tuition and \""the new post office guy\"" checked it in twice as delivered, and its NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. Again, Miss Property Manager just said \""It is not my problem.\"" and \""You are the third person who has come to me with this issue.\"" How am I supposed to feel comfortable about receiving confidential and pertinent mail? \n\nI hate writing all this bad things about Lakeview because, really, I love my 2bd/2ba apartment, I love the pool and the complex is absolutely beautiful! But I have been left with no choice at this point! I am so aggravated and disgusted about the way I have been treated. And my real issue is that NO ONE is going to do anything about it!",114563
3,"Try feta cheese & vegetable or asparagus omelet here.  The hash browns are crispy and one of the best I've tasted. Fast service, people watching late night is entertaining, be sure to check out the lounge. It's a Vegas experience worth checking out if you are visiting town. I recommend.",169029
3,"Mm, I'd like to give it 3.5 stars.  \n\nBacchanal Buffet is in Ceasar's Palace, beyond the casino and near the desserts cafe. You can't miss it, it's where the HUGE line is.  We must have gotten there by 12pm and didn't get seated for another 1hour and 40 minutes.  line was crazy.  We got there and ordered the bottomless mimosas, which end at 3pm. We paid about $41.99 for Sunday's lunch.  \n\nThere was a good variety of food there. There's asian foods in the back (sushi, peking duck, ramen, udon noodle soup, etc), then cheese and charcuterie, pizza and pasta (the meatballs were really good), then there's your mexican/latino station (it's more like a taco station), BBQ station (some were really dry. I got the ribeye and that was juicy but really fatty), french fries and tator tots (sweet potatoe tots were really good), then lastly, your seafood station. The seafood station had snow crabs, oysters, and shrimp. I wanted to see some more stuff like lobster tails, maybe steamed mussels, but none of those were available.  \n\nSalad station was limited but I liked the garbanzo salad and the japanese seaweed salad.  \n\nDessert station was AWESOME. get the lava chocolate chip cookie, mochi ice creams, and coconut macaroons. So good. We also got a ice cream cone on the way out of the buffet.  I highly recommend it, it was a good experience and worth the wait.",570054
4,"Delicious food - definitely french influenced, with just the right amount of spice.  The fact that it's BYOB is a huge plus, as these types of restaurants are usually just so much better.  They can't make money on their 350% markup of alcohol, so they really have to do well with the food.  This restaurant did not disappoint, both in service and taste.\n\nThe inside is very small which makes this a pretty intimate place.  My girlfriend and I were clearly having a date night, but there was a row of tables lined up next to us that was set out for a large party.  It's nice when a restaurant can be small enough to have an intimate atmosphere, yet still accommodate a large range of group sizes.   I had the prix fixe menu, which was a LOT of food (so the price tag wasn't unreasonable at all), and every portion of it was delicious.\n\nIf you're visiting Montreal, GO TO THIS PLACE.  If you live in Montreal, I am supremely jealous.",334788

3,"From the moment we arrived every last staff ember treated like royalty with a homey twist. When we made the reservation, we put in a note that we had a gluten free person in our party. And every staffer watched out for us. Turns out that most of the menu was naturally gluten free.\n\nWe started with heirloom tomatoes, micro basil, balsamic and a perfectly delicious cheese that melted in our mouths.\n\nWe split the bone in rib eye medium rare for our main course. We also split fire roasted asparagus and the best fries I've eaten outside of my own. Everything was absolutely fabulous and worth every dime.\n\nThe dessert menu was lengthy, and when we were informed that they make all the ice creams, sorbets and sherbets fresh the only question was what flavor. We finally settled on sharing a serving of Strawberry Hibiscus Sherbet which was topped with a little flavored sugar-I think it was hibiscus. A great ending to our yummy meal. \n\nI had a Shirley Temple with dinner. The cherries were dark red. Another supper tasty detail. And that's were these Heritage Steak sets a pretty high bar. I enjoyed my meal here more than The meal I ate at  Ruth Chris New York. \n\nWe very much enjoyed the design and open kitchen concept. The decaf coffee was the only thing that wasn't perfect, and it was so out of character compared to everything else that I had to drop off a half star-I give 4.5 stars.",616479

1,"I came in here on a Saturday morning a little after 9am.  The gentleman who was working on my pedi started clipping my nails with a cuticle nipper.  I thought it was really odd, I've never seen anyone use cuticle nippers to clip nails, especially for my nails, which were long overdue for a pedi.  Anyway, I wished he trimmed down the nails some more (I should have said something).  As he was clipping my big toes with this nipper, it hurt so bad I started saying, \""ouch!\"" but he ignored my whining and went on to clipping.  Later, he went on to scrub the bottoms of my feet, and that, itself was not good because he did it so lightly that it was the uncomfortable ticklish feeling.  The nail painting itself was good though, and I was out of there in about 40 minutes, including drying time.\n\nI should add, when I walked in, there was another woman who already had her pedi started.  I was already done, and she was only halfway done.  So depending on who you get, you'll either get really fast service, or really slow service.  She commented on it to the man who was doing her nails, but disregarded what she had to say.  She also commented as the guy was scrubbing her feet, how that experience was, \""not a good one,\"" to say the least.\n\nThe only reason I stopped by here is because they open at 9am on Saturday.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",438984

3,"Came here on date night with another couple before the Cirque show. It was a Thurs... so the place was not that busy. \n\nFood was excellent. Appetizers were served quickly. Since we were all sharing, the waiter offered to add an extra shrimp to the cocktail - to make 4 (1 for each - they are BIG). He did the same for the other appetizers. Nice touch, made it so we all could have a little taste of each.\n\nFood is served entree and large \""\u00c0 la carte\"" sides - like any good restaurant should. We again split all the sides - with waiter making sure there was plenty for each.\n\nI ordered a margarita (rocks/salt) - came in a 'girly' wide-top glass. I did ask for a normal tall drink bar glass on my refills...waiter obliged with no problems.\n\nOverall - good place for an adult date-night. We will definitely go back.",328300

2,"Oh Lidia's!  How you've forsaken me!  \n\nI came here with a group of friends after having talked up the calamari entree.  Three out of five of us got it (the others had the osso buco and a pasta dish - the osso buco was good, and the pasta dish was a \""meh\"") and I just wanted to put my face behind my hands and whimper out of embarrassment.  The dish was totally watered down and not flavorful at all.  I did ask for it to be made a little less spicy, and I think their solution to that was to dilute the sauce.  But, another one of us had the entree at full strength, and it wasn't much better!\n\nI was questioned as to whether I would come back again, and I suppose I would answer yes to that, but only if someone else wanted to go.  After this experience, I don't think I can face the disappointment another time.",2923
2,"If you love fried chicken & chicken wings, you'll enjoy this place! I decided to check this place out when I had a craving for some chicken wings and honestly BWW just doesn't do it for me. Ironically, this location was across the street from BWW so thought eh what the heck, I'll try it. \n\nOnce we arrived it was dead! However, that didn't discourage me from trying this place. Looking at the menu, the AYCE is the best deal. At first, I was a little confused on how the process worked since the hostess/cashier/waitress really didn't explain it. But in the end I was ok with it. After an hour, then service picked up.\n\nSo enough with the fluff, let's get down to business. These little suckers are huge! Seriously the first basket with 10 pieces will get you full. Make sure to split the order with 2 flavors so you can sample at least 2 different sauces. After the first basket, each basket comes with 5. And nothing says awesome like $1 PBR to wash down the wings. For a minute there, I felt like I was a competitive eater as I raced to beat the 12-yr old kid that kept eating wings. Unfortunately I paid for it after 30 some wings.\n\nWe seriously tried every flavor - sesame soy started off good but by the 3 wing, I need something to drink. It became salty and the sauce was thick. The Garlic Parm wasn't bad but honestly just tasted like fried chicken. I love sweet chili but they didn't put enough sauce on these suckers. Remember folks, if chicken is battered and deep fried, more sauce is needed than usual especially when the sauce is thin. The hot sauces were pretty similiar to Hooters. Overall, if you're a fan of Hooters, you'll enjoy this place. It's quieter, $1 beers and big screens to keep you entertained. Plus as Stephanie mentioned freshly brewed tea!",501027
4,I love the Arcadia area for it's amazing thrift shops and nicely hidden delicious dines. Bertha's Cafe is definitely one of those little spots where you can count on getting a quality sandwich or pastry and wash it down with a fresh batch of watermelon lemonade. I also got a parfait there once and it was the best! The serving of fruit was very generous. As for the lunch crowd you'll see a ton of working moms and other older people there getting food. Also there is a thrift shop right next door if you have time to kill afterwards!,276840
1,"Service: Waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged by our server, he actually seemed bothered that he had to wait on my friend and I.

When someone gives their sixty day notice just combine the charges for those final two months in just one bill instead of two separate billing statements.,399506
4,"The Buffalo serves wings, boneless wings, boneless wings sandwiches, and salads that can be ordered with or without wings.  I like my wings with the bone, otherwise known as tradition wings.  There are some twenty odd flavors.  Currently, I get half hot and half Thai curry.  Top that off with some fries, ketchup, carrots, and blue cheese and you've got yourself a lunch special.  The loyalty card is a nice perk, $5 off every few meals or so.  The servers are very generous with the punches.  And if I ever managed to fill out the survey from the receipt, I would be saving even more moolah.  For a little bit, I was using SCVNGR to unlock some deals.  It is an app that requires you to complete challenges, and if you get enough points, you can unlock deals.  It was fun for a few weeks, but then seemed like a lot of work.  They've also got drinks, but come on, man, this is my lunch break.",478465

4,"I absolutely love this place and truly wished I lived closer. I am a big fan of outdoor malls and there is something for almost everyone here. I say almost because there is only one store that my husband is interested in shopping in. But...this review is about me not him! ;) For me, I love the mix of more well-known clothing stores and local boutiques. I love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as Paradise Bakery, Chipotle, ColdStone Creamery, etc. In the summer, they have the misters going and in the winter, it is the fireplace. There is also a Harkins movie theater. Apart from the middle strip of shops, I like that I can hit up a Target, Ulta, BevMo in one stop. Who cares if I need to drive across the marketplace, the key thing is that I don't have to drive across town to find shops that are all in one place...so convenient. I don't get the parking complaints from other reviewers. How is that the fault of the marketplace? There is an over-abundance of parking spots, but it can be hard to find a spot due its popularity. If you are a bargain shopper, you can go to their website and print out coupons for its shops. My husband and daughter got BOGO frozen yogurt from Mojo Yogurt today. There is also a little splash pad in the middle of the shops that is great for the little ones. This is a great place to cover anything you might need.",290100
3,I am commenting on the super Bi-lo in Matthews on Fincher Farm lane.  The managers and sales staff are quite friendly and do go out of their way to assist you. They recently overcharged me on an item that was still advertised as buy one get one free but they made good and refunded all the  money plus I got to keep the item. Can't complain about that. I wish they did offer more gourmet items as Harris Teeter does but I like the shopping experience there and they do have good deals on lots of items that I buy frequently. That is why I keep going back.,420184

1,"Only scoring a two star because the food was edible and the vibe of the place was very cool. After spending a lot of dough on an amazing meal at STK the night before we decided on a more casual less expensive (or so we thought!) one. Todd English has gotten a lot of buzz on Top Chef so why not? Well this is why not: the food was ridiculously overpriced, carelessly made and couldn't hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost. My $20 plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back, when it came back the flavor wasn't even up to Costco's high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce. I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was $87 before the tip!! $20 for one beer flight of four tiny tastes? Really? The only thing I enjoyed about my meal was the French onion soup but beware for $9 it'll be half the size of the one you are used to. This place is a miss for me. Not coming back unless Todd invites me to dine for free.",445505

The last review was probably written by an old man that was stuck in bed and glued to a TV instead of out enjoying the night life.\n\nWe were out there for a football game and this hotel situated us well within a 15min drive of the stadium as well as a few bar and grills. \n\nThis place was great. It provide all that was needed. Clean room, great customer service, breakfast. I must admit the breakfast wasn't the best but at least they try. The restroom sink was situated outside the restroom which was kind of odd but no biggy.  Conveniently located next to eateries within walking distance and a supermarket in a 5min drive. Our check in was easy and fast, parking was easy, and yes we had little noise with a occupants of the hotel being mostly football fans but it was no big deal. People out having fun. This place is on the map next time I'm in town I left this hotel being a happy camper.",54655

Sat outside and watched the fountain show at the Bellagio. Me and my bf had the chicken liver pate and the onion soup, 22oz steak with fries, half chicken and mashed potatoes and a large french sangria to drink... AMAZING! Must try! It's worth the wait at the door! And all the servers were super nice",168643
4,"*This review is only in reference to the restaurant. My friend and I did not experience it as a club.*\n\nI absolutely love this place. If you're looking for a unique experience in Las Vegas, this would definitely be a place to have one. My friend and I love burlesque so if you're not so much into that, I don't know if you'd like it as much as we did.\n\nThe truffle mac & cheese is to die for. I've ordered that at a few other places and Cathouse, by far, had the best. The mushroom ravioli was a bit hard but it still tasted good. The dessert menu here is to die for. I have only eaten at an average percentage of Las Vegas restaurants but I'm pretty sure this is the only place where you'll be able to order red velvet cake and peppermint cotton candy.\n\nThe burlesque atmosphere manifests itself in almost every detail of the restaurant. The red patent leather doors, the black and white pictures on the walls, the waitresses' outfits, the interior of the restaurant, and best of all, the window. As someone who has no interest in nudity but loves to watch sexy girls dance, I really liked that every half hour or so, a very attractive girl would appear behind appear in a small room behind a large glass window. She would change behind a blanket, apply makeup to herself, read, etc.\n\nThe food is reasonably priced and tastes delicious. I ordered a Southern Belle as my cocktail and now I am totally a whiskey fan. I would love to come back to this place on my next trip.",300132

3,"This place was on the DD&D places my family wanted to go while in town, I joined them since I'd heard plenty about it but never gone.\n\nThe place is small, so yes there is going to be a wait.  You chose to eat there knowing this so complaining about the wait is pretty ridiculous.  That said, I'm not sure if I'd attempt coming here on a weekend, but during the workweek it was fine, the wait was maybe 20-30 minutes.\n\nThe food was great, the coffee was strong.  My only complaint is with more than one person checking on our table we asked for water from them 2-3 times and I don't think they ever came back with it.  Wasn't that big of a deal but seemed like it wasn't that hard since they were checking on us about every 2 minutes (got the feeling of being rushed through our meal, but maybe that is their way of keeping the flow of folks coming in and out).",193495
0,"Horrible. After hearing so much about Grimaldis and the lack of good pizza on the west side of the Las Vegas valley I thought I'd give it a try since I live less than 2 miles away. While ordering I asked for a side of pizza sauce and they asked if I wanted to come in to pick it up or if I wanted curbside pickup. I asked for curbside. They said 20-25 minutes. I left right away and arrived there 10 mins. after placing my order.  I parked in front and after 5 mins of waiting I decided to go inside. To my surprise it was already at the bar waiting. If it was ready why didn't they check to see if I was there to give me my pizza? And after sitting at the bar for who knows how long the pizza was cold. I got home 24 mins. after ordering my pizza. If I had waited the time they told me I would have picked up an even harder, colder pizza. The sauce was refrigerator cold which was annoying. The pizza was paper plate thin and although I ordered extra cheese it barely had any. I had to reheat the pizza when I got home but even so it was horrible. For $25 the largest pizza they had was so thin that all 8 pieces barely filled my wife and I. Metro pizza is much better and half a pizza fills us both. Will never go there again",502625

It was a huge wrap, but not very tasty. I ate one third of it. The baked beans and potatoes salad were not very good either. I regret not having just plain chicken or ribs. They looked and smelled good. I'm not sure that I will go back because the television was on Fox News. I could never sit through that again. Public places should never have televisions on stations that may offend their customers. It would have been better to have it off.",74394
1,"Claustrophobia galore! My boyfriend and I had reservations for his birthday and we were scared of hitting someone with the door! Raku is a small restaurant with tables so close to one another that it's not only  difficult to move around but it is challenging to have an intimate dinner with those you love. The portions and price ratio are somewhat outrageous! (Small, dinky portions and it costs a lot!) Can't say I was too pleased with my time here.\n\nIn my personal opinion, this place is overrated. My friend had glorified this place like no other and even the yelp ratings confirmed his love for this place. Unfortunately, I can't say the same :(. I expected this place to be so very close to how the yakitori places are in Japan. This place definitely falls short. \n\nDespite my disappointment, I must say, I was impressed by the quality and the menu. However, for the price and atmosphere, I don't see this as a worthy place to dine in. We ended up getting a few skewers of meat; I know we got the wagyu beef which definitely stood out, the tofu (the best thing I had on this menu) and grilled tako. No bueno on that grilled tako; I felt as if I was chewing on a rubber chicken that was burnt flavored. Blah! I honestly don't know why this place is highly rated; it's between \""good\"" and \""ok\"" but it isn't \""OMG this place is the s**t!\""\n\nI really tried to love this place. I tried to accept and tried to convince myself that I'm paying for high quality food, but seriously, this place is almost an insult. I had to stop at $85 worth of food because I wasn't sure how much I would need to spend to feel full and satisfied. I'm sad I wasted my hard earned money here and couldn't give my boyfriend an awesome birthday dinner. Vegas needs to step up their game on authentic yakitori places.\n\nPS. if you decide you want to go to Raku, I suggest not walking in as you are unlikely to get a table as a walk in. So make sure you try and get a reservation...",320859
1,"Very dive-y looking in the front.\nWe decided to try it out a few months ago when I was pregnant.\nWasn't terribly impressed. We ordered a meat plate/sampler, that just had the meat and cheese thrown on there. When our pizza finally came, there was a pool of grease sitting on top of it. I've had it better frozen, out of a box.\n\nFor whatever reason, we decided to give them a second chance, with delivery, about a month later.\n\nThere was a mile long black hair baked into our pizza.

0,"This store seems to be very hit and miss. I had ordered a 2 tiered wonder woman cake and it was perfect and I loved it. If it had been that experience alone I would have given them 5 stars but unfortunately it is not. I also ordered a lady gaga cake and this one missed the mark. The fondant it's lumpy and the piping it's extremely uneven. When I called to voice my disappointment the decorator Jay would not have it. He changed the cake was perfect and that if I wanted a specific look I should have agreed for it.  I will post pictures of the cake and what I feel the problem areas are. Sadly, I will find a new cake shop BC of his reaction and the quality.\n\n**UPDATE 8-6-14**\nSomeone from KAK has been harassing me on Yelp sending me messages as to question the validity of my statements. Claiming that I must have left the cake in the sun or that for some reason the quality of the cake is my own fault. Truth is I was unable to confront Jay face to face because I was uncomfortable with that but made sure to call him as soon as I left the store. The cake was kept cool under the AC in my brand new car and at no time had extreme exposure to the AZ heat. Jay had told me that the fondant was still soft because he had just finished the cake, mind you I ordered it nearly a month in advance. Never will I ever deal with this establishment and I will make sure that no one I know will go to this place.",371117

I put a $27 insurance on top of for the day, thinking it was a simple $27 charged. A $92 total balance for the rental for one day in Vegas wasn't too bad. THING AGAIN! I was billed an extra $114!

That is because most classy places will serve you almost no food for a lot of money - here things are different.\n\nWhat makes this place so special is that in the more unpopular restauranting hours of 12-5 Monday to Friday when most people are working you get 2 for 1 on meals.

2,"Frederico Fellini was a brillant and enigmatic Italian director of films in the 50's, 60's and 70's. 4 of his films won an Oscar for best foreign film.\nIf you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . \n\nHis movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. \n\nHe is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.\n\nThis Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. \n\nThe Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.\n\nService was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. \n\nInside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film. For something more like that, just step back out onto the Strip!",286905

Walking in, there's a room that exposed raw cattle hanging from the ceiling ready to be charbrioled and served. I thought that was interesting. We got seated promptly and our waiter was very polite. \n\nI ordered the Ribeye steak with a side of  mashed potato (my usual combination). The bread was decent and house salad was good. The steak came shortly afterwards and had that charbroiled aroma to it. It was a hefty piece and had the right amount of char. The steak was pretty tender, juicy and had an all natural steak flavor.

I had read some horror stories about other buffets, so I was pretty picky about where we ate on our first trip to Vegas. This buffet did not disappoint.\n\nFirst of all, it is expensive. $80 for two people, but that did include all you can eat and soft drinks. The buffet was the most high end I have ever been to. It had appetizers which included a variety of salads, a meat and cheese spread, shrimp cocktail and more. The main course dishes went on forever. Crab legs, bone marrow, lobster claws, mac and cheese bar, fried chicken, sweet potato mash, Korean short ribs, pizza, I could go on and on and on. My absolute favorite thing by far was the gnocchi. It was quite possibly the best gnocchi I have ever had, the sauce was fantastic, the gnocchi was perfect, soft and cooked to perfection. I would go back and only have that every single time. The dessert section also seemed to have an extraordinary amount of variety. Puddings, gelato, cake, pie, cheesecake, cookies, rice pudding, and my favorite, enormous chocolate covered strawberries dipped in Heath bar or Reese cups. Again, if all they served was gnocchi and those strawberries, I would pay for it time and time again.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, our server was great, she kept our table clear and our drinks full. It wasn't super busy when we were there, but I can imagine it would get a little crazy if it would be busier.

Bad because it piled up and sometimes we'd have to wait long but oh wellz.\nWe walk in and the lady at the Counter is as SWEET AS CAN BE. Very nice, helpful, and just plain sweet.\n\nThe room was okay. Not too bad, not too great, just meh. Right when I walk in my mama goes \""there's a red dot on the ground and I don't know what it is!\"" LOL... Ummm okay? We just avoided it. Whatever. It looked like Cool Aid. \nThe sink was tiny. Dude. What the F. Like seriously. \n\nWe just got ready and slept so it wasn't a big deal at all. I've stayed everywhere. Doesn't matter to me.\n\nOne thing I liked is that it's a short walk downstairs, to the room, to the car, to the Fremont Street Experience, and just to about everywhere. One gripe is that it's so far from the Strip but it was nice to get to check out Old School LV ya know?",121113
1,"First of all don't buy more than one yelp coupon at a time cause you can only use one at a time and they stated that they prefer to give one ticket per table. Now I'm stuck with 2 more coupons that I probably won't use. The salsa was a little hot for me but the chips were fresh and delicious. We got the cheddar quest and it was delicious as well. I was very exited for the creamed corn side dish and it was a little hot for me but was delicious and I ate it even though my nose was running from it. I ordered the quesadilla and it was just basically plain chicken and cheese. Finally something not burning my mouth. My dinner guests had the Barbacoa burrito, which was huge, and the tilapia Cesar salad which looked good. Everyone ate all of their food! The service is where this place goes down hill. Had to wave her down for everything and wasn't overly friendly. If your going for the food it's pretty good just don't go there looking for the best service.",485441

0,"Two words: Chile relleno. \n\nThree more words: With the seeds?! \n\nThe order is small (which I don't mind) and so is the price... I figured that matched up and it was, overall, a tasty dish. But they don't clean the chiles? I have had this before when I noticed that, I figured it was an honest mistake. As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly. \n\nIt has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.\n\nHowever, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present. \n\nAdd to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.\n\nHistory was already \""meh,\"" and now #lunchfail.

2,"Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\n\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \n\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.",869

2,"Ohhh sweets and bright colors are my weaknesses. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? Yes please! \n\nWalking by the Sugar Factory on the strip was too enticing to pass up. This one, located outside Paris, is a fairly larger candy store then the other two locations (at the Mirage and the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops). \n\nTrue, most everything in here is really overpriced. But there are some cool things to look at. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? So tempted to buy. They have some cool novelty items, like couture pops, charm bracelets, hello kitty chocolate bars. I also found some key lime chocolate bars that looked interesting. Sugar factory has their own line of chocolate bars (2 for $5). I ended up picking up a 30 day supply of chocolate squares ($18). The squares are the size you'd see at Ghirardelli, and they come in a variety of flavors (milk, dark, raspberry, smores, caramel). Oh and did I mention cool packaging? It was a gift for my bf, but I'm eating a lot of it. Sharing is caring! =)\nThe chocolates are really good actually. The quality is up and there and the taste is really smooth without being too sweet. \n\nOh and the candy store has a gelato/ice cream shake bar. My friend wanted a scoop of gelato. One scoop is $6. Eeek. And the scoop was tiny! We tried the panna cotta. It was way too sweet! I don't think this place is worth it for a frozen treat fix. I'll pass next time. \n\nWhile I was at the store, I also noticed that it was attached to a dessert boutique. Didn't get to try it, but definitely want to next time.

We arrive around 6:30 on Thur night to find out they are not offering outside seating tonight. On such a nice night, no outside seating? really? There was a 20min wait so we headed to the bar where we encountered a less than happy bartender. This is my 2nd time here and same rudeness at the bar. I asked for a glass when he gave me my beer and I never got one, same issue last time I was there.  We were seated in 15min. Our waiter was great. Our order included a hamburger and I got a rib eye. I ordered it med and got rare and there was way more fat than meat. terrible. My steak was not good the last time I was there but thought I would give it another shot. nope, just as bad.  the only food that was good was the corn on the cob, all other food, horrible. The band is too loud. All I could think of is when are they going on break!  another reason why I wanted sit outside so I wouldn't have to listen to that God awful loud music.  Bad choice to go there if you want good food and be able to converse with your friend.  Best thing about the place is the view.  I won't be returning.",31913
4,"My first experience with Ethiopian food! I was hesitant, as it is a cuisine I knew little-to-nothing about, but holy moly - I was so surprised. Four girlfriends and I ordered the vegetarian exclusive (I believe it's called) which is meant for three people, so we also ordered the vegetarian platter meant for one. We hardly finished the exclusive, there was so much food! Everything is SO tasty. I was worried about the injera, as I have friends who don't like the consistency of it. I really loved the fresh sourdough taste of it, though, especially mixed with the flavors of the different wats. \n\nAfter my first visit, I was so excited to take my boyfriend there - we made dinner plans with friends of ours within two weeks of my first trip! I absolutely LOVE Lalibela and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite stops for delicious vegetarian food!",110479
2,"It's not often I find myself on Murray Ave, but i was meeting a friend over at BRGR for lunch and took the long way. I was at a red light when I noticed a parking spot near this bakery. Not too often you can get a spot on Murray right near the place you're going to, so I took it as a sign.\n\nI'd been here before, the first time was late on a Sunday afternoon, when I walked in just about everything was sold out, I had my mouth watering for texas toast made with  Allegro's 12 grain whole wheat bread. Damn Like Seinfeld, someone ahead of me got the last loaf. I settled for a regular whole wheat. I really enjoyed it. \n\nThis time I was lucky and got the 12 grain I wanted.

2,"I was sick and tired of buying convenience store wood... It burns up way too quick, and is usually $5 or more a bag, to boot. After a quick swipe of the ol' iPhone i found Glowing Embers, just down the street a ways from my house. There's a certain manly aspect to shambling through the woodpile, getting your hands dirty, and then going home to build a fire.\n\nTheir selection is fantastic, REAL hardwoods that take a nice amount of time to burn down. The staff was real friendly, although one of the dudes working there was pretty scary in that prison-tattoo-make-sure-you-lock-the-car sorta way.\n\nThey measured my buddy's pickup truck and did some quick calculations, saying that to fill up the bed it would be $160. Since I didn't have that much cash on me they instead directed me to a roll away cart that we could fill up to the line myself for $86. We went for the cheaper option, and I honestly don't think we could have fit another $70 worth of wood into the truck, but I suppose I could be wrong. You DO have to pay for better wood to burn, and it's not exactly plentiful in the middle of the city.\n\nI don't think I'll need another truckload anytime soon, but I do think it's definitely worth the drive when you look at what you get versus what's available at the gas station or even Home Depot.\n\nI'll probably be back for a big bag or two before winter is over.",250520
0,I am so upset to come here and place such a large order late at night with no one really there so obviously it shouldn't be that hard to get the order right. \n\nIt's another fast food spot that you don't expect customer service from but the least they could do is get the order right. I call to speak to a manager who Ofcourse doesn't speak English that well and if she does she sure didn't sound like it on the phone.  \n\nAs she sat there telling me what she did to our order I'm explaining to her that it's wrong with missing items she talks over me to correct me.

Sucked because that's what I was most looking forward too. :/ and apparently after talking to anther couple there.... the \""greenish\"" pool was actually an improvement over the previous day!

I've shopped at Best Buy before... not for any major purchases, usually just for CDs or DVDs, never had any problems until now.\n\nI decided to buy a computer from them. Biggest waste of time/money. First of all, their \""computer experts\"" couldn't tell me anything about the computers that wasn't written on the little spec cards on the displays. But i had done my own research, so i thought I was making a good choice. I also bought it \""optimized\"" which is where for $39.99 they have Geek Squad go through and get rid of the programs that you dont need and do all of the updates. \n\nI got home, and right off the bat had problems with the computer. It was shutting off randomly, wasn't downloading programs correctly... pretty much just a bad product. I returned it today, which brings me to...\n\nTheir HORRENDOUS customer service. They checked over the computer and did declare that it was defective. Then they told me that they would refund my money... minus the $39.99 for the optimization, because \""labor charges are non-refundable\"". Well that's great, except for the fact that they sold me a DEFECTIVE product, AFTER I paid them extra to make sure that it wasn't defective! But they really had a hard time understanding that. I had to talk to a salesgirl and two managers, one who had to call a higher up. For $40. come on people. I think I fought with them for a half an hour. They were ridiculously rude, and really had nothing to say except \""it's our policy not to refund labor charges\"". Long story short, I eventually was reimbursed the full amount and was rid of the POS computer. \n\nLast time I EVER shop at ANY Best Buy",315055
1,"This place was a Mega Cafe, a Coco's and Mi Tierra, prior to becoming Fiesta Chips and Salsa.\n\nI don't think they will be around long, Mi Tierra had much better food, at much more reasonable prices. Mi Tierra charged $7.50, including taxes, for a beef chimichanga, sides of rice and beans, with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo on the side, with iced tea. Chips and Salsa charged $12.00, including taxes, for a burrito with a little shedded lettuce and a small slice of tomato on the side, with iced tea. As I said, if Mi Tierra, selling better food at lower prices, went out of business, I don't thinks Chips and Salsa stands a chance,\n\nThat being said on with the Yelp:\n\nThey start you off with chips and salsa, no surprise there. However, you would think with the name Chips and Salsa, they would have good chips and salsa, they don't. The chips were cooked wrong, they were cooked at too low a temperature for too long. The result was over cooked, on the edge of burnt, oily chips. The chips were so oily, they were shiny, as if someone poured oil over them. The salsa was okay, nothing to write home about. With salsa in their name, you might think they would have brought a variety of salsas for the chips, (Mi Tierra brought two kinds of salsa and bean dip to go with the chips, while you were deciding on what to order and while they prepared it.).\n\nI had a Grande Meat Burrito (carne asada), it was okay,  Carne asada, rice, cheese, beans and pico de gallo, in a flour tortilla, though I didn't notice any cheese. It was not served with any sauces, I would think a place with salsa in it's name would want to showcase their salsas, guess not. Although size is relative, the grande burrito was closer to medio, than grande.\n\nWhile there I heard several complaints from people, on the lines of \"" there's suppose to be guacamole served with this\"" or \"" I specifically ordered this with the sauce on the side, they put the sauce on it and tried to scrape it off'\"". So apparently the kitchen doesn't know what's on their menu or how it's served and have trouble with simple requests. I assume the servers corrected the mistakes, but it's always more impressive to get it right in the first place. As near as I can tell, I got what I ordered, so it appears I was lucky. The server checked to see if I needed anything else, refilled my tea, etc. so I have no problem with the service side. I gave an extra star for the server, a girl with dark red hair, or they would have gotten a one star.\n\nThere are too many good Mexican restaurants in town, to settle for what they offer at this one. I won't be back.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAngie M.commented, \""hey wen did u went to fiseta and chips salsa and wht time   u should talked to the main manger \"" [sic]\n\nIn my response to Angie, I took the time to translate into English, corrected the spelling of fiesta, corrected the business name and answered her questions.\n\nQue lastima (what a shame), this may account for the mistakes people were having with their orders.",639622

I was excited to see that they had lobster bisque as the soup of the day. \n\nThey had a lot of meat to choose from.

I decided to try this place because I kept passing it on my way to work and I remember seeing all the good reviews about it. I decided to order 2 donuts and asked if I could sub out the milk for the orange juice (combo #3), and you would've thought I had asked for free donuts. Unfortunately, I can't drink milk, so I thought it would be no problem to swap it out for oj (especially considering the milk was more expensive than the oj). Fine, I'll just get the donuts. I get up to pay, and find out my order has to be $2.50 or more to use a debit or credit card (mine came to $1.93). So I end up grabbing an oj, making it more expensive than if they had let me do the combo! Now for the donuts...I got a Boston Cream (my favorite), and it was not great. The donut itself and the chocolate were ok, but the cream on the inside was just gross. The sugar donut was ok, but again, not great. I will probably not be coming here again.",396893

I will give the atmosphere and decor a 4 star, it's cute and has a nice set up with a lot of potential. And here comes the big but again, BUT you can't serve overpriced crappy food with great beer. You can't have a team that doesn't know anything about your great beer selection & brings you the wrong samplers. You can't have them correcting you multiple times on how to pronounce a beer if they get it wrong!! You can't have them give you the wrong tables check at the end of service. You can't have them wipe down a wet table while your seated with another wet, disgusting bar towel & then make you wait while they search for a dry one to finish the job. You just can't do any of those things & expect repeat customers. The food was bad, really bad! And when you are talking about the great beer, why would we come here if we could go right down the street to a Brewery who also has great food & beer that isn't overpriced! Let me say, we don't have a problem paying high prices for great beers or great food or great service, but when you miss on all counts, it felt like a waste of money.

2,"It's alright, nothing special.  We had the Phoenix dog, Classic Cheese steak and a Coney dog.  Phoenix dog was a poor attempt at the Arizona famous Sonoran Hot dog.  Coney dog, well, was a very small but tasty dog.  The Cheese steak was good but not over the top.",243360

1,"This is a 2.5 star review.  They advertise as a fish and steakhouse.  Instead they should advertise as southern cooking.  Now I love southern cooking but there is more to southern cooking than deep fried and blackened.  \n\nPositives\nDecent selection of cocktails and food items (within the limitations of what I mentioned above).\nVery nice waitress.\n\nNegatives\nOf four of us that ordered steaks I was the only one who didn't have to return mine.  We are all prior military and have eaten some crappy food so to actually return something means it was really, really not what we ordered or very bad.\nHostess, sadly, was really clueless.\n\nIf only one of us had to return a dish I would have given them at least 3.5 stars.  My steak was good but we had a table of six people and only two were satisfied with their meal. One was mildly disappointed and three were bordering on pissed.",377101
1,"This is not real mexican food.\n\nWho serves beans with chips?  The beans were good but the concept was not understood.  Even in Mexico they don't give you a bowl of beans with chips for an appetizer.  It was free though so plus for that!  The salsa was decent as well and of all the food we ordered (5 people total), the carne asada was the best flavor with grill tasting all over it.  Cute how they give you a \""serrano\"" chile with each meal.\n\nEverything else was bland.  My fried ice cream was not crunchy and way too hard that we couldn't finish it because we couldn't wait for it to melt more.  A little over priced too.",114306

Plus, they have a great discount program for frequent shoppers and they give you a 20% off coupon if you make a donation. The only downside is that the prices are a bit high. You really have to work the coupons along with the daily 50% off color items to get a good deal.",483396

I guess it comes with a DVD rental place. \n\nIt is quite large and slightly shabby looking but definitely has a lot of choice. However, their european/foreign movie selection is somewhat disappointing. Plus in what self-respecting DVD shop would it take them ages to locate Nemo?\n\nSo if you are after a blockbuster (ha pun to the name!) or something along those lines you will find it here. Ask for the student discount if you have an approved uni card.",356017
1,"6 of us went to Binks Midtown on friday night for a friend's birthday dinner. I would give the ambiance and food a 4 or 5 but the service was quite poor. My friend touched the bread serving dish and burned her hand so badly her fingers blistered. There was No warning about the temperature of the serving plate and there were  no apologies for her sizzling fingers either. She asked for ice to stop the pain and had to repeat the request 4 more times to 3 different people to get a simple ice-cube - which finally appeared about 15 minutes after she was burned.  \nThey knew ahead of time that it was a birthday for one of our group and there was not even a cupcake or a happy birthday wish from our server.\nAppetizers were brought out one at a time and out of sequence so  some of us were nearly done while others had yet to receive their starters.\nThe server seemed unaware of the use of \""please\"" or \""thank-you\""\nEvery request had to be made 3 or 4 times - everything was so slow it spoiled the experience. \nAs I said, the food was special but the service was so poor, I will not recommend it nor will I return.",599154
3,"Went to see local bands play here last night with Amy D and her awesome friends.  Totally my kind of bar...dark, dirty, divey, and with killer bands playing.  Very spacious...but that could have something to do with the fact that the place wasn't really packed. \n\nI didn't drink this night, but I did notice that Budweiser was $6.  (Not a beer drinker, but that seems a little high, I think)  But somebody was buying the drinks.  I think last night was the first time I actually had a guy fall on top of me.

1,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for a Saturday night date. We were seated quickly by what appeared to be an owner. We'll call him \""The Boss\"" (tall man with a baseball cap on). The Boss sat us, bussed our table, wiped it down, and then gave us menus. Said our server would be with us \""shortly\"". \""Shortly\"" was the understatement of the year at this place. The Boss came back about 15 minutes later to ask us if we'd ordered drinks yet. We hadn't.  He ordered and brought us our drinks. 35 MINUTES LATER our waitress Morgan appeared. We'd been watching her serve the couple at the same table we were seated at and several tables near us for the past half hour. We ordered food. Entire order was wrong and Morgan didn't offer to take it back to have it fixed. We were also charged for food portions we didn't order as well as paid for the incorrectly prepared entree. We also watched the Boss seat a new couple next to us and get their drinks as well. The waitress finally asked if they needed new drinks/food an hour and ten minutes later after they had been sat. An hour. And ten minutes. Really? Really. The food here was amazing though. That's the only reason they got two stars. The boss was excellent as well. Hosting, bussing, serving, cleaning, and probably cooking. Food is great but good luck getting service!",420936

3,"A really good branch of a fantastic Edinburgh coffee company.\n\nUnlike Starbuck's laboured \""cosmopolitan\"" style, this place really does feel cool. Inside is a wooden, natural aesthetic, with low level lighting that makes the place feel like some strange forest haven.\n\nI first visited Black Medicine when staying over at a friends. In the morning we came here for breakfast and I enjoyed a lovely croissant and cappacino. Since being back I've tried their smoothies several times and I have to agree with Gavin! I find this is a great place to spend a while, soaking up the atmosphere and reading the paper slowly while enjoying a pastry and a drink.\n\nA really great remedy (that is medicine...) to the stifling omni-present coffee shop chains.",358380
1,"I really like the Red Rock Resort.  My friends and I stayed there so that we could do some mtn biking and watch the ncaa tournament in the sports book.  The resort is nice, clean, and not too crowded.  After staying on the strip the last couple of times, this spot is much more convenient.  I'd probably still stay on the strip if I was with my wife though, since there are no shows or fancy restaurants at the Red Rock.\n\nThat being said, I was really disappointed with the Feast Buffet.  It was about $22 which is not expensive, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the food.  I ate a little of everything, and nothing was particularly good.  Sushi was worse than what I can get at my local Ralphs.  The BBQ ribs were dry.  Hardly any fish to chose from.  Asian section was about as good as panda express.  Really, nothing great about it.  I was more excited about the Fat Burger that I got in the casino food court.  Come to think of it, I also got a great prosciutto sandwich in the casino too.  Next time, I will try the bbq place instead.  \n\nBTW, if you are staying at the Red Rock.  There's a great Whole Foods down the street that has a lot of prepared food.  You can pick up really good stuff there and bring it back.  Also, across the street was an Italian pizza/deli that was good too.",234172
0,"DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!!! I would give them a zero if I could. I actually paid for the service and it is a complete scam. They promise you that if you pay for the listing you can contact the owners directly. They don't mention that it's by mail only!! In addition, they have a prewritten letter they have for you to send to the owner is to request for a rent to own. I don't even want to own a home. The listing on Trulia was for rent. I thought that they were legitimate because I have paid for a similar service before from a different company however I actually received direct contact information. Also I assumed that since it was on Trulia then it was ok (that was my fault for assuming). I have also seen them on Zillow so be careful. I wish I would have read Yelp first.

0,"So looking forward to this dining experience last evening...had been recommended by several folks in person and the reviews on Yelp only pumped up my taste buds more...\n\nIf this is Las Vegas Mexican food at it's best then someone needs to have their head examined....it was downright BLAH.\n\nChips and salsa up front was nice touch but Salsa nothing special. Beans were nice free touch too but tasted like straight out of a can. We had several palate's to please. picky 15 year old, 18 year old who loves fish and anything fresh, your texmex appetite and mine who embraces any different, fresh or just darn good food.\n\nHow can you mess up a plain chicken quesadilla... two bites and 15 year old  was done...tasted it and couldn't agree more. Shrimp enchilada sounds good and as there was so much shrimp on the menu you figured it was a easy home run. Chewy and fishy covered in a plain sauce...18 year old didn't get through a 1/4 of it and others at the table agreed. Chicken Enchilada, come on how easy is that...apparently not to easy! Barely passable and again just plain. I had the 3 pork chops, Chuletas was the dish name, marinated overnight in a secret sauce. Don't bother, chops dried out and the sauces only secret is that it smothered the pork chops in something I would only describe as tasteless.\n\nThe service here was excellent (besides 3 requests for water) and can't fault them in this regard. Almost all the people in their, both small and large parties seemed to be celebrating a birthday party and it was just way to loud. WARNING sign - they listed fish on the menu but all they had were shrimp. This leads me to believe they do not shop fresh produce, how can you not have fish tacos on the menu!!! Come on and yes this only dawned on me after.\n\nWe finished our meal and probably returned the food about 75 - 80% untouched. There was an apology from the waiter but no manager to come and ask why, no credit on the bill... NOTHING.\n\nWe left our tip and were out of there and likely to never return...$100 down the drain.\n\nI am rarely this bad when writing reviews but when you have options like Mundos in town and Don Juan for texmex/fresh food then I would recommend you steering clear of this over rated Mexican establishment.\n\nSorry Lindo...",145130

0,"BIRTHDAY FOR HUBBY UGH\nFirst of all I booked this on Priceline, I booked a room with a separate living space. It did not happen that way at checkin. WE WERE actually given a standard room.\n\nWe also called the hotel directly on May 10th, to verify the bedding would be hypo allergenic (no goose or down at all), I requested a fridge for a medical need, and a baby crib too. I was also promised a beech credit of 50. I recorded the call to verify all was ready to go.\n\nWe selected the M BAY for the pools, shark reef exhibit, and the it being on the end of the strip, with the boys. \n\nWhen we arrived it took one hour and thirty minutes to check in. No help with our bags. After the checking in the issues and more concerns piled up, only to not be resolved in a timely manor, or only after asking for the same item more than once. If it even was resolved at all.\n\n\nThe standard room, was dirty.\n1. Hair on bed and pillows.\n2. Toilet had number 2 stains in it.\n3. Snack tray was there, but item was open gross I am hoping no charge for that.\n4. Wrong bedding\n5. there was no way I was going to stay in the wrong room either.  I spoke to the main desk. who promised us help quickly. \nWe Waited for the agent we spoke to to come move us he did not?\n6. We called guest services again and then were told to hold by Rachel. She spoke To agent one and said he actually would not move us right away and that the wait was not too bad, and then stated the first agent had to get permission from the supervisor to help us. However he did not and was unable to call us back in the whole forty minutes we waited.\n3. All of a sudden the crib shows up, and he tries to put it in the room. Unfortunately that is when I called back to the desk, as we were moving rooms or so I thought. \n\nTHE SECOND ROOM WAS WORSE.\n1. The view was nice, but that's all.\n2. It was still the wrong room, as it had no king and no separate bed for the kids, no living space, and no baby crib, or fridge, \n3. Dirty headboard with white fluid on it? I have the pictures. The room smelled like smoke, and would have to wait for bedding to be changed. \n4. Called and spoke to The only assistant night manager, who was awful his name was TREA, (Trey).\n\nHE WANTED TO JUST HAVE US WAIT IN THE FILTH AND HAVE A MAID EVENTUALLY CLEAN THE ROOM. I WAS NOT ABLE TO ALLOW THAT WITH OUR  KIDS AND US. THE ROOM WAS REALLY NOT CLEAN AND WAS IN ITS OWN RIGHT A HEALTH HAZARD. WE WERE EVEN TOLD TO STORE MEDS IN MINI BAR.\n\n\nANOTHER ISSUE, we took our bags to the bell desk as the assistance never came to the room to help load them. I was so upset I ended up talking to TK as I refused to talk to TREA. He had us store our bags at the bell desk.We then had to leave our bags at the bell desk while again they tried to fix the room cleanliness issue, and get us into the correct the room. I brought down my iPad to guest services and showed TK the booking to make sure it would run smoothly. He said it would be correct and that the crib and fridge would be in the room and cold when we got back. The only thing is we would have to have call down for our luggage when we get back to the room later. All of this took at least another hour and a half if not more.\n\nROOM THREE - WORSE YET AFTER RETURNING AT TEN AT NIGHT, \nwe came back to the room only to be shocked by just a king bed. where does my older son sleep!  Where does the baby sleep. \n\n NO BABY CRIB NO FRIDGE. WE HAD JUST REPLACED THE MEDS FROM CVS.  Which one expensive fix. It was still the wrong room. I called down to guest services again, and was told they can't get another room right now, but could get us or correct room tomorrow. They left us in a jam and we were forced to take the room as is. Tub was dirty too. The baby crib did not show up after three calls and closer to midnight, and the rollaway bed that was promised for our older son never came. The fridge came before the baby crib at 11:39 PM. I was very upset at this point. \nAs soon as the baby bed came, everyone crashed. My poor husband in a chair as we did not have enough beds for us. A great way to spend his birthday trip sleeping, waiting and asking for help with issues. \n\nTHE FORTH ROOM, \nFINALY THE CORRECT ROOM, MY HUSBAND HIMSELF MOVED US IN WITH WHAT HE COULD CARRY AND WAITED FOR THE REST OF OUR LUGAGE TO ARRIVE. he waited forty minutes. The fridge never came, the baby bed had to asked about two times, but the room was right. Crappy view beyond what vegas should have, literally faces another wall, and when you look down there is a ton of pipes and bird poop. AGAIN I HAVE A PICTURE. \n\n\nHERE IS WHAT WE WRE PROVIDED\n\nCRAPPY FLOOR SERVICE WHILE AT THE CASINO, got one drink in two hours plus.\n\nA SHARK REEF VISIT ON THEM, AND a 100 dollar credit. We also requested a late check-out do to our super late check-in and all the room changes. \n\nIT IS NOT WORTH IT TO STAY HERE.

3,"Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.\n\nWe go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.\n\nOur first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.\n\nShortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the \""heavy\"" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!\n\nStrip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor.",257611

There were about ten people waiting to be seated, and we had stood there for nearly 15 minutes. One person wiping tables looked up and saw us all standing there, and went back to wiping tables. We left and went to the hotel buffet.\n\nAbout a month later we went back. No problem getting seated this time. The problem was getting waited on. We sat at the table for nearly 15 minutes and no one approached us. Finally, as we were about to walk out the door, the waitress came by and handed us menus. She said she would be \""right back\"" with our drinks. Another 15 minutes passed (the place wasn't terribly busy). By this time I was fuming - and I'm usually pretty calm and tolerant about these things. Finally - 45 minutes after we were seated - we got to place our order. When the food arrived it was overcooked and dry.\n\nAdd bad service to the significant price increases throughout the Friday's chain ($16.95 for a dish with two pieces of chicken?

Our oldest two sons had a birthday party to attend. We decided to take our youngest out for an early dinner. We arrived shortly after 4 and the place had a few patrons but was not at all busy. We seated ourselves and someone attended to us right away. The service was outstanding; very friendly staff. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing. The food? Excellent! Salads came with our meals and were brought out first. They were nothing exciting, just simple salads but I usually don't expect much with a salad. As long as it isn't brown I'm happy. We ordered garlic bread and it was perfect; crispy but soft. The marinara sauce was delicous. We also ordered the stuffed hot peppers which were awesome. I had the baked ziti and my husband had the lasagna. Both were delicious. We both commented on the fact that Gallo's reminded us of our favorite Italian place in Japan, Angelo's. Yeah, I know...Italian food in Japan? It was great though. Our son ordered the kid's pizza and we tried that too. I prefer New York style thin crust and this has a thick crust. But it is a buttery, garlic crust that is worth eating just by itself. It was a wonderful experience and a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe are definitely going back.",147527

1,"Longgggg time to get the drinks, longgggg time to get the food, untrained personnel,  dry food, poor quality ingredients,  huh....I give it 2 stars for their sauces...but would not recommend!",298291
3,Very cool place to eat just outside of main Charlotte downtown area. I has the burnt ends and baked beans. Baked beans are AMAZING! 30 bucks for 2 people including an app. And you can smell it from the parking lot and shops nearby. My wife said the turkey sandwich is the best she ever had.,512257
2,"Meh, it was okay. Just like any other 3 stars. But this is a little too pricey for my liking for just OK food. The service was just normal as well.",69769
0,"I was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from the owner yesterday in regards to my experience at The Dog Wash. I explained what had happened during Milo's grooming visit and she offered a blameless apology. I find it very comforting to find people that can apologize for a situation instead of passing the blame along to the next person, even when they were not at fault to begin with. She informed me that the person who groomed my dog on Saturday is no longer with the company and she asked if I would be willing to give The Dog Wash another chance. I was hesitant, but because of her sincere and helpful customer service I decided to give it one more shot. \nI won't give it a 5 star rating just yet, I still have to say what Milo's hair will look like, but it is a step in the right direction.",455664

1,"I met friends here on the suggestion of Happy Hour eats n drinks. Arriving to the restaurant there were only 2 parking spots open and they were behind the beer truck that was blocking them, next to a foul smelling dumpster and gas tanks sitting out in the open. \nIt was about 4:15pm on a Tuesday. \nI parked and entered and found the ambiance pleasant. I would recommend some blinds for the atrium seating so that during sunset your customers arent in a greenhouse.\n The server was exceptionally polite and helpful and attentive. He even escorted me to the ladies room and advised me they were unisex. He was just a peach! \nThe unisex bathroom however, reeked of urine. There's a reason ladies prefer their own lavatory! \nStructurally speaking, and this is being really picky, when you wash your hands in their unique sink, the faucet sits so low to the basin that your hands come close to dragging in the dirty basin that others have used. Icky. \nOnce the last minutes of happy hour grew near though, our server's attention, understandably, waned. They got slammed. Perhaps a drink runner for that last hour of happy hour would have aided us in getting our drinks BEFORE closing out AND paying our tabs. \nThe food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd, they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections. They fell flat.\n I then ordered the olive medley and a bread loaf which they purportedly bake on site. The olives were plentiful and tasty. The bread however was burnt. It had big empty holes in the middle so the amount of bread was slight. \nOur cocktails were also unique, however some of them fell flat while others were so immensely strong we had to send 1 or 2 back. \nThe reason i will never return to St. Francis isnt even any of the above although it contributes. But the icing, the cherry on top was departing the joint. \nNow I get why these hipster trendspots hire valet companies. The need to \""accommodate\"" the customer who drives, is hopefully met by an attendant who crams your car into a packed lot meant for only about 16 cars. \nWhen I arrived there was no valet to squeeze me into my spot behind the beer truck, next to the dumpster, near the gas tanks. But when I left my car was again blocked in, this time by other cars which had been sandwiched between my rear and the cars in the lanes behind mine. \nit took quite the effort and my passenger getting out to guide me, to get out of my spot safely.\nOn my exit, backwards, through the lot and around a corner, only then did I notice the valets. One was running about, the other seemed  a bit oblivious, flustered. I rolled down my window, and said \""You guys have to be kidding the way you block people in, \"" I said smiling, trying to make light of the situation. \n\""Most people know.\"" he replied.\n\""Know what?\"" I asked.\n\""To let us know.\""\nConfused, I wasnt sure what he meant. \nMy passenger said \""You guys blocked her in and she could barely get out.\""\nThe attendant responded, \""Look lady, that's the name of the game.\""\nMy passenger said \""What game is that?\""\nHe replied sarcastically, \""Well if you've ever been to St. Francis...\""\n\""I have not\"" I cut him off as he continued to try to explain that we should have known to come let them know so they could move cars to let us out. \n1st of all, from my spot I couldnt see that there was even a valet set up.\n2nd of all- to get your attention then to wait for you to rubix cube cars around would have inconvenienced me, YOUR CUSTOMER AND THE PATRON OF THE RESTAURANT THAT HIRES YOUR DUMB ASS TO CAR JOCKEY! \nTo which i replied \""I have not been here before and I wont be back now\"" to which he replied\n\""Well good \"" and rolled his eyes.\nSt Francis- the valet is the first and last impression of your restaurant. And that is why, more than anything else, I wont be back and I try to avoid places that use valets b/c they are too cheap to buy extra land to accommodate the numbers their trendy new spot might bring in. Additionally 9and not in your case since our drinks were priced for happy hour) my money that pays for inflated bar and food prices should cover me for FREE PARKING and not to have to pay or even tip some juvenile dipshit whom I wouldnt let drive my car if he was my own relative!",250256
2,"After enjoying I Love Lucy Live Onstage at the Knight Theatre uptown hubby and I decided to stop into Amelie's for hot beverages and pastries since it was close by. What was our experience?:  just average. First of all it's such a small space. There is hardly room to move around or even to sit if there are more than a hand full of people there, and since it became crowded quickly after we arrived we just felt like getting out of there. It's a cute little space, but there was nothing fabulous about it to me. My hot chocolate and pastry were okay, but I don't know that I'd return. There are other options to consider where I would feel more comfortable and relaxed. After all, isn't that why you go to a coffee shop?",475711
4,"It was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. The hotel is lovely and comfortable, the rooms are very large and laid-out very intelligently to allow guests to live and work in the room in comfort. There is a work desk and a large sofa and even a wet bar with refrigerator. The decoration throughout the hotel is very attractive. The fitness center is large with a nice variety of machines. The staff could not be better, everyone who works here is friendly and efficient and really helped us with our business and personal needs. The free breakfast is the best I have ever had at a hotel and the 24-hour menu is nice and not overly expensive. The Internet connection was fast and reliable. I could not have been more pleased.",418812
2,"Met up with friends on a Saturday night, so it was packed. Later in the night the number of children dropped. For something out of the ordinary, it's a good time but a but a bit expensive.",350689
4,"Very nice for their holiday menu!!! Excellent!!! Especially the snow crab legs, fresh and tasty. We took 5 dishes of them ! And they have Asian food their, the Chinese toasted pork buns are nice@@ I also strongly recommend their desserts, they are very cute and small so you can taste different flavors:)",189171
