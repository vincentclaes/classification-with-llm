5,"Incredible coffee, on the same level as LUX coffee bar and perfect for people closer to the Tempe area. Go to LUX for the atmosphere and cartel for the coffee and make sure and try the Iced Toddy it was incredible!",303120
5,Pizza is really good and hot wings are too. Service has always been good girls have never been rude good customer service. We usually order a Hawaiian a couple days ago we found out it actually comes with pizza sauce and bar b que on it which was so gross. It was just one time the employee didn't ask but now we know and it has been great! Fast service and delivery good hours and location nice parking!,474126
2,"Place is falling apart!  Just outside of the Blue Man Group theater is a bikini clad dancer on to of the bar ( and not good ones). Is this a down town club?  Come on Monte Carlo, clean it up, decorate, replace\ntorn furniture. Your on the strip and supposed to be better.",162806
3,"It's not often I find myself on Murray Ave, but i was meeting a friend over at BRGR for lunch and took the long way. I was at a red light when I noticed a parking spot near this bakery. Not too often you can get a spot on Murray right near the place you're going to, so I took it as a sign.\n\nI'd been here before, the first time was late on a Sunday afternoon, when I walked in just about everything was sold out, I had my mouth watering for texas toast made with  Allegro's 12 grain whole wheat bread. Damn Like Seinfeld, someone ahead of me got the last loaf. I settled for a regular whole wheat. I really enjoyed it. \n\nThis time I was lucky and got the 12 grain I wanted. This bread is pretty amazing with lightly browned smoked tofu, charred arugula, peppered greek olives, and veganaise. No vegan restaurant makes a sandwich like that.(Thanks Deb! She's my dietician)\n\nI need to get my butt out of bed early one day and get up there when I have the entire bakery at my whim!",77420
1,I went here twice the 2nd time we came the Waitress was a total bitch and very disrespectfull to my friends sister I've eaten better lebanese food! I've worked in a lebanese Resturant  not to say that the food sucks but the waitress we had was horrible!   and the food there is just ok cause like I said I've had better !,270379
2,"i like their chicken biryani. That's the only + thing. Their Shahi paneer didn't have any salt in it. Last time when i visited this place during dinner, the water they served me had a hair in it. The server didn't had the courtesy of apologizing. Plus i didn't find the staff to be very courteous.",303420
3,"I love boba milk tea's & smoothies! So I was excited to see a place around my area that makes them. When I went inside it was very clean, however not so welcoming. They weren't rude or anything, just not inviting y'know? Anyways I was craving a Taro Smoothie with boba so thats what I got. It was done very quickly, however upon drinking I wasn't too impressed. The boba was good, but the actual drink was VERY gritty. So much that I really didn't enjoy it. I am giving three stars for now, until i return and try more things.",504841
2,"Disclaimer: I am not a resident at Paragon. I went in looking for a 1-bedroom apartment. \n\nI am on the hunt for an apartment and I took myself through north scottsdale today, stopping in at paragon on my tour. I would say that just about every apartment sales office that opens on sundays (some don't, granted) opens at 12PM and stays open to 4 or 5PM. I arrived at 12:45 to find out that Paragon doesn't open until 1PM. lame. I toyed with leaving and not seeing the property, but didn't listen to my instincts (mistake #1). I waited it out and came back at about 1:05. \n\nI walk inside and there is no one at reception, well fine, i'll just wait. Someone yells from the back \""Morning!!\"" I don't know if they are talking to me so I say nothing. \""MORNING!!!\"" again. \""oh hi there\"" I reply. \""You are just going to have to wait, I'm setting up still!\"" Huh? Who says that? I wasn't complaining about waiting, and besides that, you don't talk to clients or prospective clients that way. \n\nIris walks out and offers me a cookie as she walks by saying \""you know we don't open until 1PM\"" me: \""It is one, isn't it?\"" her: \""barely.\"" UGH! Why didn't I leave?! Then we are talking and she's getting my info and she asks my price range and then tells me \""oh well you won't find that here.\"" and yet I didn't leave (mistake #56 at this point). So for the first half of the tour and explanation she is a big puffed up elitist telling me how exclusive this is or how fancy and amazing that is.  Amazingly by the second half of the tour she was telling me she could get the price down to my price range (through flagrantly faulty math) and saying she could really picture me here. Yikes, no thanks lady!\n\nA 1-bedroom here runs $990 a month with no utilities included. The apartment and the complex are nice, but I have seen apartments that are equally as nice with the exact same amenities for $250 less per month. And with the offensive attitude of the sales person, I simply cannot imagine what kind of elitist douche-bags actually live here. if you are a normal person living at paragon, god bless you i don't know how you do it.",363105
3,"good sushi, nice atmosphere and the price is right!!!",205117
3,"Very nice location. Two-floors. Came here with a very large group of about 30 people without prior notice. The waiters split us into three smaller groups which we did not mind. Two groups were next to each other. The other group was across a walkway. We were fortunate to get the waiter who was probably new. He seemed to be a little panicked while the other waiter looked like he knew what he was doing. As for the group I was in, we had to wait a long time between ordering our drinks then ordering our food. This cause us to be the last finishing our food while the other group was ready to head out the door. Other than the service, the food was as expected...Good! I give the food four out of five stars. Service was a two out of five.",210156
4,"Friendly service and fresh ingredients are the stars here.  I tried the special for the day, battered cod with 2 sides.  Our waitress explained that the cod was a fresh filet and hand battered.  I had it with steamed vegetables and clam chowder.  The clam chowder was also freshly made, and had nice large chunks of clam in it.  The chowder itself tasted a little too salty for me though.  The green beans were freshly steamed green beans, and they were a nice deep green color vs. the greyish mushy green beans you might usually see at restaurants.  \n\nService was excellent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Our waitress was very warm and friendly.  Sunny's Diner is hopefully here to stay for many years!",561819
3,"This place came highly recommended by an acquaintance, but I have to disagree. I ordered a sirloin steak sandwich and got 3 thin slices of reconstituted beef (like Arby's uses).  My guest ordered a chicken sandwich.  It also had virtually no meat.  The greek salad was good and the side green salad was of a good size. The help was very young and inexperienced.",451085
1,"This place leaves a lot to desired. My dad and I went during the week because he was craving Mexican food. So, I suggested we give Gil's a shot - trying to support local restaurants. \n\nIt was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren't deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). \n\nWe started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. \n\nThen, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. \n\nFor entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. \n\nThe 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's. \n\nAnd my rating is not because I'm comparing this place to normal \""Mexican food\"" places - I know this place is supposed to be \""New Mexican.\"" I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them.",371079
1,"Found a house to rent. Went down to realty office to fill out application and it was a wasted trip.  I walked into the office and 3 people saw me at the counter and no one welcomed me to the office. I had to ask for assistance. Already with a bad taste in my mouth, the front desk man was dressed unprofessional and lacked any information in regards to renting a property.  He insisted that  i sign my application and turn it in without the blanks $ amounts filled in. I refuse to sign an application without knowing all the fees involved.  I asked numerous times to have a sit down with someone in the office to answer all my questions and i was told no. I would have to call the realtor on the phone for any answers.  I am very unhappy with the customer service this business offers to their potential clients and i will not refer any one to this place.",442995
1,"After a night of watching rugby at a local bar, we head to Paris, for some zzzs.\n\nDeep into the night........\n\nHubs: \""Baby, this place has bed bugs, I have just been bit!\""\n\nGame over.",161792
4,"FIrst off, I will definitely be back. The location is a little sketchy, but nothing terrible. They do have a little dinning room that seemed to fill up quickly. I went there primarily for the pizza and the pizza was delicious. We did not get the deep dish. We didn't have enough time to wait. However, I will be back to try the deep dish. The thin crust that we ordered was delicious. \n\nThe only reason I take a star off is for the wings. They were terrible. I ate one and could not stomach anymore. The chicken tasted old or rotten. But again, that's not their specialty. Next time I will stick to just pizza.",115655
4,Went for lunch and had the French Dip sandwich....very good choice but man what a gutbuster!!!,175067
5,"Leaving a review for Taco Bell.  I can't believe it but the drive through attendant, she was so sweet polite and businesslike. The food was excellent!!!",246038
2,"Such a large menu, which covers several different Asian cuisines, is always a red light to me. I really don't believe any kitchen can specialize in Tai, Chinese, Vietnamese AND Japanese cooking. Therefore I ordered sushi, fried tofu & hibachi. The sushi was really good; fresh & well-made. The hibachi was fine, a big plate of meat, rice & stir fried veggies, all fresh. \nThe fried food was inedible. My tofu was flavorless. I wanted a light, panko-battered dish served crispy and hot, sprinkled with fish flakes. I got lumps of lukewarm tofu rolled in corn meal, cooked off quickly and not even given a sprinkle of salt. My companion's fried softshell crabs were just as awful. Once again, flavorless, cold and definitely not fresh.\nI think this place could be successful if they specialized in the late night crowd--drunk and starving and looking to fill their bellies at 3 in the morning--because apart from the sushi,  Akahana is little more than an Asian Denny's.",495226
1,"The one at Alexis Nihon is really the worst. \nThe shelves are half empty, they wanted to put so many different departments that all of them are incomplete. Women's and men's clothes are disappointing. Nonetheless, I took 2 pieces to try on. At the changing rooms, the 2 teenagers were hidden behind a few piles of unfolded clothes and took a while before they saw me. They pointed the way to the room and it was a MESS ! The tiny hallway was cluttered with stuff and clothes and the room as well ! At least 15 pieces were hanging and on the floor with a bunch of broken hangers. I had no where to put the clothes so I just left without trying anything on. A man that seemed to be a manager there was yipping and yapping super loud all over the place and the shopping carts are just carelessly anywhere in the entrance blocking the access. Yes, customers leave them anywhere because that's what lazy people do but no one seemed to have picked them up since the start of the shift. Anyway... It's a free for all and Walmart looks high end compared to Target Alexis Nihon.",625413
4,Very cool place.  Nice craft beer selection and their lemonade is great.,622048
1,"I am getting sick and tired of restaurants in this economy that don't know how to treat a customer.  It is not like they are over flowing with customers at best 1/4 filled.  I ordered the Croque Madam  when it came out the egg yolk was ice cold.  I asked the waiter if he could replace the egg.  Rather than just bring out a new sandwich the waiter came out and essentially blamed me and said the cook said that the egg was not cold.  Now I am irritated and ask to speak to the manager, a few minutes later, the so called executive chef comes out and continues to insult me.\n\nDon't waste your time with this restaurant, food is sub par the executive chef is clueless and the service is even worse.  They should just close the entire Aliante Casino.  It is one of the worst Casinos to eat at or gamble at.",579583
5,Wow! What excellent place. Definitely get a burger and go for the white chocolate ale. Loved it!! Plus they allow you to bring your dog to the back patio. Sweet.,534817
1,"Was excited to visit this place because I love desserts and dessert drinks.  My husband invited a group of people to meet us there after dinner. My sister in law and I walked right in, but my husband and a friend were stopped and told they were not within the dress code. My husband wore jeans, a sweater and dress shoes and was both confused and irritated; we have been to lounges and places  in Hollywood with him dressed the same way and have never encountered a dress code problem.  To make matters worse, when my husband pointed out that there was a \""fairer skinned\"" person right before us, who was let in wearing a T-shirt, the manager simply said, \""To imply that I am a racist is ridiculous.\"" He then told us to leave and later threatened to call the police.  This type of treatment was extremely disappointing; and to think, I thought Charlotte was considered the \""New South.\""",384266
2,"I had a hankering for thai food a couple weeks ago and found these guys on Yelp.  I ordered about 40 bucks worth of various dishes... shrimp pad thai, green curry chicken, spring rolls, a thai iced tea and I think that was it.  I don't remember all that well because most of the food went into the trash.  The iced tea was about the only thing that was exceptional.  Everything else was pretty much blah.  Not a lot of meat, and the curry was super greasy.  The pad thai was dry and tasted like it was anything but fresh.  My quest for GREAT thai food continues.  The one thing that surprised me is that when I went to pick up my order, their dining room was packed with lunch guests.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes (???)",227668
5,"Every time we g to AZ, Phoenix Art Museum is on our list of things to go and see. The changing exhibits are wonderful. And, the price is right -- you only pay a nominal fee for parking.",90714
5,I love this place !! We come here all the time for a chill place to smoke hookah at. Me and my friends love it ! Highly recommend it. And the food is great !,590784
4,"This is one of those places that is created especially for people on expense accounts... or Donald Trump and homies. The decor is my favorite part....half retro supper culb/half canadian hunting lodge, and located in the cobblestoned alleyways of Old Montreal. Tiny portions dictate that each person order starter, entree, and dessert.... I had the lobster with tuna tartare starter; my colleagues had the olive tapenade and goat cheese stuffed lamb with crab-stuffed zucchini flower. Service was fine, slightly cold, but that is not surprising. The food is good, but the ambiance is really the reason to go.",335090
2,"Cute place in a good little neighborhood however this was not my favorite breakfast spot . My husband and I stopped by to order omelette and traditional French toast. I was very excited to eat there since I had heard lots of hype about the place. When we got our food I was highly disappointed by the cold potatoes that were given to me. Also, the omelette was meh... Considering all the yummy breakfast options on Melrose, this place is not my first choice.",592527
3,Jimmy john is one of my favorite place to grab but after tonight it went down hill. I ordered a vegetarian sandwich and took it home once I got home it had ham and what not. It was the worst sandwich I ever got!!!! I called and they said I'd have to go drive back to get the sandwich I wanted in the first place. This is dumb and very annoying.  So to warning to all customers check ur order before going home.,523972
5,"Delicious food - definitely french influenced, with just the right amount of spice.  The fact that it's BYOB is a huge plus, as these types of restaurants are usually just so much better.  They can't make money on their 350% markup of alcohol, so they really have to do well with the food.  This restaurant did not disappoint, both in service and taste.\n\nThe inside is very small which makes this a pretty intimate place.  My girlfriend and I were clearly having a date night, but there was a row of tables lined up next to us that was set out for a large party.  It's nice when a restaurant can be small enough to have an intimate atmosphere, yet still accommodate a large range of group sizes.   I had the prix fixe menu, which was a LOT of food (so the price tag wasn't unreasonable at all), and every portion of it was delicious.\n\nIf you're visiting Montreal, GO TO THIS PLACE.  If you live in Montreal, I am supremely jealous.",334788
2,"They forgot my spam musubi =( i guess i don't get one even though i payed for it..i got \""put in the system\"") lets see if it get lost in the sea of lost...along with my chopsticks and spoon..lol i ordered soup, teriyaki bowl, and 2 musubi ..my girl loved her musubi.. all i got was soup... i would give this place a 4 if they would have gotten things right...",478371
4,"I don't gamble, and if I do it's like $100. I'm the type of Asian guest that the Palazzo doesn't want, and they do cater to Asians since over 80% of the whales and hi-rollers are Asian. That's why you'll be properly accommodated if you want to watch Korean, Chinese, and Japanese TV shows (I hope they have Viet channels cuz Viets sure do throw down big money in Vegas).\n\nI only have some small issues with the Palazzo because after all, it's supposed to be a 5-star hotel?\n\nPROS:\n- Overall big spacious rooms (everybody's reviews below spells out the specifics).\n\nCONS:\n- The design of the Palazzo is very middle-of-the road, and it doesn't take the themed gimmick route like the Venetian, New York New York, Paris, Excalibur, etc. Instead, they've designed a fairly lackluster interior that's very forgettable. Even the lobby seems indistinctly tucked away into one side of the main rotunda which can be overlooked if you're not paying attention.\n- The management was gracious enough to let us check-in early since we got in prior to 3pm, but I don't know if room service would have put the finishing touch on everything, but I noticed a bunch of annoying details:\n  1. the lamp fixture in the bathroom was tilted, and it needed to be straightened out.\n  2. Small gripe, but when someobody's in the bathroom frantically spinning the toilet paper roll, you can hear it while your laying in the bed. This could take a toll on having \""sweet dreams\"".... I imagine dreams of trying to balance yourself atop a log while cruising down a river of chocolate... yea chocolate.\n  3. Design wise, the door knob they decided to use on the doors is deceiving because I had a friend say \""there's somebody in the bathroom\"" because they couldn't turn the handle thinking it was locked. Instead, you just have to pull on the door - either you're a moron, or it's intuitively ingrained in us to turn a handle. \n  4. Like the Se Hotel in San Diego, there's a gap in the bathroom door which is a huge perverted plus because they also don't have a lock on the doors. So if you have female guests, they'll have to barricade the doors if they can't trust you. My friend didn't shower.\n  5. It would have been nice to use the refrigerator in the room, but any sort of movement in the mini-bar would have resulted in additional room charges. Not to mention, the ice bucket they provide you is extremely tiny. \n  6. The bell check didn't bother helping us with any of our luggage when we drove up!?! They only assisted the people getting out of the taxi cabs. What's up with that? I know they don't offer valet, but isn't this the simplest thing they could do because it set the tone for the remainder of our stay.\n  7. Out of the 3 bathrooms, the bathroom TV wouldn't turn off, and it also didn't have the same channels as the other two?! So we couldn't find the shows we were watching on the other two.\n\nOverall it was a decent stay on NYE at the Palazzo because the rooms are so spacious which is great for hosting a bunch of your friends prior to going out. I bet Chinese New Year would be even better in Vegas. Maybe, I'll have to get a room number with 8's in it and take up gambling.... well Happy New Year!",292711
4,"Try feta cheese & vegetable or asparagus omelet here.  The hash browns are crispy and one of the best I've tasted. Fast service, people watching late night is entertaining, be sure to check out the lounge. It's a Vegas experience worth checking out if you are visiting town. I recommend.",169029
3,"Good burger. Made to order right on the charcoal grill. You select your patty size and type of cheese.  Customize your own burger with basic condiments.  Add fries and a drink.\n\nCustomer service, nonexistent. The cashier didn't even say thank you when I handed him a tip.\n\nThe store itself was hot and muggy. It felt like it was hotter inside than outside, and outside was over 104 degrees!\n\nOverall, a decent burger but not worth it.",113728
2,Walked in on a Friday night and waited for someone to decide to help us. Lots of staff just walked by till finally someone came and helped us. There were visably at least 5 or 6 available tables but still we were told a 30-45 minute wait? really? we went across the street and got a table right away. This place is pretty but that seems about it all it has to offer.,609606
3,"you DONT reserve a room at excalibur expecting much or expecting anything actually. you reserve a room here if you're on a budget, want to stay on the strip, and only need the room to sleep in, and a toilet for your friend to throw up in the whole night (gross) ...\n\nmy friends and i decided to be spontaneous and head to vegas this past weekend to EAT, GAMBLE, and PARTY...not to live glamorously. and since i'm staying at the palazzo in a few weeks, i decided to make this trip my ghetto vegas trip. \n\nwe were trying to be as cheap as possible so we could spend our money on other things (food, gambling, alcohol) there was 4 of us total and we booked a room for 2 nights for $274... ($69 per person for both nights!) prettttttttty damn good, AND its on the strip.\n\nits really not completely shitty, but its definitely not the palazzo. for what we needed it for (bed, bathroom, table to put our alcohol on) it worked out quite well for us!\nits located across the street from MGM, next to luxor. you can easily take a cab to go up the strip which is exactly what we did.\n\nthe casino isn't that classy but again, don't expect it to be. they had a casino war table here...i didn't even know that existed! quite possibly the easiest (and dumbest) game in vegas. \n\noh and they have the 4D spongebob ride here!!!!! i realllllllllly wanted to get my friends drunk and have them ride it with me, bc they wouldnt have sober, but i didnt have enough time.............next time..........",127163
4,"I went on a Monday and there was no cover for men or women...yay!  For a Monday, it wasn't dead but it wasn't balls to the wall either.  Tao Beach is really small so on a regular weekend or big Holiday weekend, I'd think it would be too packed.  On weekdays, it's topless optional.  Some women had the boobies out but majority did not.  I had raspberry mojitos and they were really good.  The DJ was really, really good on this particular Monday.  Not sure if it's the resident DJ or if it was a guest DJ.  Security was super friendly too.  The place closed promptly at 6pm.",238885
3,"I was really excited about this place before walking in because Butcher and the Rye is really hard to get a reservation.\n \nFOOD - I had mussels, marrow, pig candy, duck liver pate, and wagyu flank steak. The portions were good, price were good, and everything tasted good. Though we ordered our steak medium rare, it seemed a little overcooked and asked them to make it again for us, which was again a little overcooked. Overall, other than the duck liver pate, everything was mediocre.\n\nSERVICE - service was excellent!\n\nENVIRONMENT -  I liked the vibe of the place, and it would be a great place to grab a drink and eat appetizers. It won't be a good place to bring kids or for a large group of people.\n\nI gave three stars to the place because although there was nothing that bothered me, they weren't excellent. I probably will not come back here and rather go to Meat and Potatoes.",623150
4,"Being a local, i'm not gonna be staying at hotels very often.I comped a room at The Venetian and since i had the weekend off, decided to take advantage.I stayed in a Luxury Suite in the Venetian Tower.The room was great.Nice living room area, comfortable bed, 3 TVs(chilling in the tub and watching Mike Tyson's Greatest Hits on ESPN was awesome), epic couch, etc.I had a great view of Wynn Staff parking lot and what appeared to be the Venetian employee parking.It was free so i guess i can't really complain.Just a little disappointed I wasn't able to stand naked in front of the window and have people from the other tower or other hotel gawk at my manliness.\n\nThe property itself is amazing, being only 2nd to Bellagio.It has a classy ambience to it.There seems to be always something going on there.A great selection of restaurants, bars and the epic Tao Nightclub.I had a free line pass and admission to Tao but i showed up around 2:45am and they weren't letting anymore people in.A great time to be walking around the casino, as you get a great view of hot chicks walking around barefoot(for those of you with foot fetishes).I was a little too inebriated to go to pool, so i will have to check that out next time.Had a great time there and would actually be willing to pay for it next time.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning, i ordered a pizza via in-room dining and I was told it would take about 35-40 minutes.Not true at all...it came in 20 minutes!When i opened the door I was shocked to see the clone of one of the greatest Heavyweight Mixed Martial Artists of all time, Fedor Emelianenko.the resemblance is fucking uncanny.If you are an MMA fan, make sure to order food late at night and catch a glimpse of Fedor's twin, Radek.",163602
2,"I loved the food that wasn't the problem,  it was the service.  I asked for water two different times and he comes back fifteen minutes later and asked me if I wanted water.  That pissed me off.  I also don't like it that you have to order an entree in order to get chips and salsa.  That's a staple at mexican restaurants where I come from and there are many in Las Vegas that will give you chips and salsa before your meal.  They want to charge you otherwise.",357162
2,"This store has been bought out by the people who own Bombay restaurant, and is primarily an Indian grocery now. I really miss Euro Mart.",12497
4,"Occasionally I just feel like going out for just basic breakfast, i come to this particular MacDonald's.  It's a place to have a big breakfast and watch some of the interesting people that you now are regulars among others. It's always clean and the service pretty quick. it's by no means and exciting venue!   is okay for what it is.  I am not a big breakfast eater so it serves the purpose when I am in that particular mood.\n\nWhen I am traveling I often go to a MacDonald's for breakfast.  I usually need to eat something and can count on pretty standard fare and a decent price.  If it's just before catching a plane in the morning, a Greek meal that I might prefer first thing in the morning might not set well at takeoff as a big breakfast..",19774
4,I have been here many times for dinner and lunch...mainly when family/friends visit from out of town. The food is very good and the enviornment is great. Eating outdoors is awesome when its not too hot.,106931
1,"This is the worst Starbucks I have ever gone to. They finally got rid of the disgusting couches that were a hang out spot for homeless people, but there is still a seedy crowd that hangs out around the store. The tables are always dirty, there are crumbs and litter all over the floor, the bathroom was gross.... I wish it was enjoyable, because the location would be great for studying. I didn't notice it being any quicker than any other Starbucks. I avoid this store from now on.",112725
1,"The vast chasm between the 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews of this place is very interesting... but my one and only experience with this place is ZERO stars. \nI ordered sushi for delivery, and it arrived quickly, but the order was made incorrectly-- didn't even come close to matching the menu description. No avocado, no green onion, AND no cucumber in the roll, and the wrong sauce. This was an expensive fancy roll with only 2 of the 5 listed things inside and a massive amount of rice to make it look big. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know, and the \""owner\"" (she insisted she was the owner) spent 11 minutes telling me \""that's just how we make it now\"" ... I explained that the roll was far from matching the menu description, didn't contain the full value of ingredients I had paid for, and that this situation needed to be fixed. She literally just kept saying \""that's how we make it now\"" and for a while tried the tactic of telling me that there WAS avocado on it, I just couldn't see it bc it was such a small slice.... yeah... there was not avocado anywhere in or on the roll. I repeatedly asked to speak to a manager or supervisor but she said she was the owner. So then I asked for her name and she straight-up refused to give me her name, numerous times.

3,"Certainly a decent option if you are looking for a healthy alternative to all the fast food places nearby. Pizza was good, not great. Salads were a bit underwhelming. The descriptions on the menu are better than the actual item.\nSpace is nice enough, better for lunch than dinner.",251294
1,"Food is always great, however ive been here at least 6 times and each time I was never greated, the waiter ignored me, I saw my food sit under heat lamp while waiter fluttered about not doing his job, no refils, and overall standoffish attitude of the staff will make not recommend this location.",316054
5,"Had the Lunch buffet, best Indian I've had on the west side by far. I've had 8 other Indian restaurants, and none of them have come close to being this good. \n\nFirst positive sign, everyone in the place was Indian. Second positive sign, all the food was spicy. Had to ask for a Masala Dosa for my daughter so that she could eat.\n\nDelicious. Will be back soon.\n\nThere was a TV that was too loud. I really hate having TV on at places, let alone with volume on. Someone asked they turn it down, and they I think didn't understand the English well enough to comply.\n\nCould be an issue going forward.",574364

1,"Came for a weekend with a large group of co-workers and it started off horrible from the minute we checked in! I don't even know where to begin. Our boss was going to pay not only for the rooms but the deposit you make in case anything else gets charged or things get ruined. They billed me anyways! Our rooms were not ready and they took our cell numbers and said they would call when ready, never did! Asked if we wanted coffee in our room. Never brought it! We asked them to bring sheets etc. for the fold out bed/couch and to please get it ready. Never did! At the pool we sat down and it took 45min to get a drink and just as long to get the bill! The only time we had some good service was at the little bar downstairs. Eric was great! This did not make up for anything though! DO NOT EVER GO THERE OR YOU WILL BE SORRY! I have stayed at many other las Vegas hotels and had great service! Beware!",376162
4,"We had tickets to see Bill Maher who was performing at the Palms Hotel.  We walked all around the hotel and we weren't coming up with a place to eat.  All we wanted to do was grab a quick bite and some drinks.  One of the hotel staff recommended Heraea, so we tried it.  On a whole the food and service was up to par and generally was served quickly and correctly. \n\nI'm not giving this review 5 stars because it was really nuts in there when we were there trying to have a relaxed bite.  March Madness was in full swing and patrons were really into cheering loudly and clapping hands, high fiving etc. in response to which game on what TV they were cheering for.  It was almost competitive when it came to who could yell louder.  That's hard on your nerves when you are trying to have a relaxed dinner. \n\nTake note, have no doubt, this is a sports bar and fans will yell and cheer when their teams are doing good and when their teams are doing poorly.",594390
5,"I don't do caffeine anymore, or calories for that matter... so this is my fave place to eat yummy & healthy guilt free food!\n\nThey can make pretty much any tea you can think of- I used to love chai(but I'm off caffeine, remember?) so now I always get the vanilla rooibus tea  with soy milk & a little splenda of course.  And I love their roasted chicken salad for lunch.  Something about the way they make it- I wonder what the secret ingredient is!\n\nBest part- when you get a salad or sandwich, you can add on a large tea of coffee for just $1.\n\nWhat more can you ask for?",368317
4,"This place is Amazing.  We went here for a bachelorette party and (of course) got the royal treatment the entire time.  Employees were so friendly and gracious.  The restaurants here are meh but I'm just partial to Bouchon in the Venetian :) \n\nI love that this hotel does not have a theme.  Just super chic with great art.  I wish we could have gone to the Chandelier bar but we were \""busy\"" napping and laying by the pool.\n\nOur room was gorgeous, had a view of the fountains, Paris balloon and Eiffel tower.  And they were able to accommodate us by giving us 2 adjoining rooms.  Only downsides were value for money (but probably good bc it may be deterring the trashiest) and the fact that we were in a wheelchair accessible room with no lip on the shower which made for some flooding.  Nothing that couldn't be fixed with a few towels.\n\nThe BLVD pool is amazing too.  Would LOVE to see a show here.",435840
5,Carpet Monkeys get your carpet clean unlike several other carpet cleaning companies in the Las Vegas area. After they cleaned my carpets the first time I knew I'd never use anyone else again. \nI had a very sick dog that I found that had vomitted yellow stomach bile and diarrhea (excuse the graphic description but it's relevant to talk about what type of stains were removed) on my light tan carpet that I thought would be stained for sure and Rick got every last stain out COMPLETELY! Absolutely no evidence of vomit on the carpet!\nI've used him at least 10 times now and there hasn't been 1 stain he hasn't been able to get out completely.\nHe also does excellent carpet repairs if your carpet gets a hole!,556607
1,"Being from So. Cal, I really missed being able to eat at Flame Broiler. But since there isn't one in town, I've been on the lookout for a good replacement. I read the reviews on Teriyaki Madness and they made it sound promising, like a good substitute. But alas, I was wrong...\n\nI was so excited to finally stop by and try the place out. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl to get a benchmark test of the place, figuring that if the standard teriyaki bowl is good, then the rest of the stuff will probably be the same quality, maybe better.\n\nEmployee behind the counter: \""Would you like brown rice with that?\""\n\nMe: \""Is there an extra charge?\""\n\nEmployee: \""Yes, 50 cents\""\n\nMe: \""No thanks\""\n\nEmployee: \""Would you like vegetables? It's a $1 extra.\""\n\nMe: \""Really!? No thanks.\""\n\nEmployee: \""Ok, your total is $7.\""\n\nSeven dollars for chicken and rice!! I could have gone to the Subway next door and gotten more and healthier food for half the price!! \n\nThen, I figured, the food must be super good quality right?  Wrong!\n\nIt wasn't anything too spectacular. The chicken was bland and fatty, but at least the rice came OK since there was a lot of it. It's no wonder they put a bottle of teriyaki sauce at each table.  \n\nOh, and I now know why they are called Teriyaki Madness... Well, if your experience is like mine, you'll leave MAD.",508350

3,"What a treat!  This Western themed restaurant is as hokey as it gets.  We went to Rustler's Rooste for a rehearsal dinner and the set-up outside was pretty cool with city views.  Between the rattlesnake appetizers, fried shrimp, bbq chicken and the many libations, we had good time.  The food was only mediocre, but the service was good and the tourist nature of the spot was entertaining.\n\nOne plus for the family folks is that kids...LOTS of kids are welcome.  There is a fenced-in bull when you walk in and a slide with lots of screaming kiddos.  The prices are a little steep for the quality but it is a tourist trap, so be prepared.",31804
1,"ummm if you want a good burger go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood across the street.\n\nWe stayed at the Mirage and there always seemed to be a line for BLT, it was convenient so we thought we would give it a go. Well the service was crap, the waitress never came by barely spoke to us......  I got the Tex Mex burger and it was like dripping in sweet BBQ sauce, gross..... not very good at all, I had two bites..... We also tried the nacho basket, just a soggy mess of more sweet BBQ over chips..... I am from South Texas and like my shit hot! So maybe I am just spoiled by good nachos.... who knows but if you are excepting good food stay away, if you don't really care then go for it.... You'll be wasting $100 for two people..... But maybe you are rich and don't care.  I blame this restaurant for giving me the worst hangover ever.... Thanks a lot Obama!",325944
5,"Terrific street tacos! We tried the carna asada, shrimp, and fish.  All were excellent and reasonably priced.  Had the rice and pinto beans-nothing to write home about here, they should put some effort into these two areas (not horrible but they really don't compliment the awesome tacos.  I didn't see any horchata on the menu and would have liked some but the Mexican coke was delicious.  I'll be back!",500753
5,"Two Words: absolutely delicious.\n\nThis place is chock-full of character. It's a great escape from a horrendous workday. I've never been to France but the vibe here feels French cafe-esque. The owner, who is French, is also the cashier and he is a total charmer. Plus he is happy to help you out with your order should you have any questions. Sometimes I just ask him questions I know the answer to just to hear his accent. I know I know....\nAnd It's also a family owned\\run restaurant so that also adds some warm and fuzzies to the experience.\n\nI've been here twice (soon to be 3x because I want to go back tomorrow).\nBoth times I ordered the chipotle sandwich and both times I considered licking every crumb and drop of sauce off my plate. I could say it was the flavor combination. I could say it was due to the incredible chipotle sauce and fresh avocados. I could also say that it was the fresh & crisp baguette it came on. I'll just say it was all of the above.\n\nI ordered a cup of the cream of celery soup today. I don't even like celery all that much, but I had heard the owner\\cashier describe it to the guy in front of me and I was sold. My only regret was I didn't order a bowl.... or a gallon. There was a distinct essence of  fresh celery in the soup but somehow, maybe magically, the creaminess mixed in with the freshness made this the best cup of soup I can remember. Apparently I do like celery.\n\nBoth times I ordered a coffee beverage. For the coffee snobs out there, myself included, they serve Illy coffee. For the non-coffee snobs -- this is AWESOME coffee. First time was drip coffee the 2nd was an iced white mocha.... both yummy.\n\nSo for a half sandwich, a cup of soup, and medium iced white mocha totals just 12 bucks..... a small price to pay for perfection, I'd say. Baguette Cafe is a jewel of a lunch joint. If I didn't work in the area, I'd find an excuse to drive across town just to enjoy it.\n\nRun don't walk to this place. It's an all-around crowdpleaser.",421601

2,"Thai me up and take me to a different Thai Restaurant. The price and the decor are the only things going for Galanga. \n\nThe RJ Food section gave them a cover story review and romanticized about the DIY Thai Iced Tea so since I am junkie for Thai Tea I had to experience this. The presentation was original with the tea iced cubes, but when I individually smelled one of the ingredients it smelled like nail polish remover. Ugh. Maybe my smeller was off so I continued making my tea combining all of the ingredients and it was a fail. I didn't enjoy it and spent most of my meal trying to make the damn tea taste better. FAIL. \n\nNow for the food, the only thing going for it is the price. My lunch was $4.95 and came with soup or rice porridge which fell flat in the flavor department. Both my friend and I tried to dress it up with Sriracha, but decided it still didn't work for us. Second out of the kitchen was the Papaya Salad for $7.95. This tasted different than others around the valley which was due to the lime vinaigrette. It was bitter and missing something sweet or spicy to balance it out. Sad because minus the dressing this may have been a winner. Last to arrive was my Panang Curry Chicken. The portion was to my liking and the chicken appeared to be all white meat which usually makes me happy, but with one bite I knew I would never be back. It wasn't so bad that I spit it out, but it was just boring. Nothing should be boring about Curry especially when you order it at the highest heat level. The sauce lacked thickness and spice. It was at a toddler heat level which just pissed me off. This white girl likes it spicy! \n\nThe conclusion to this story is just because a restaurant looks good and the RJ raves about it doesn't mean shit. I will gladly spend double the price for authentic Thai then come to this fancy shmanzy crap hole again.",368331
2,"oh 5th and wine, i like your name, but it felt more like 5th and whine....the service was terrible.  very very slow...after dropping off the tab we tried to get the waiter's attention for 30min, to no avail, so ended up having to pay cash so we could leave.  the art on the walls was cool though.  and my grilled cheese sandwich was good, but the dressing on my salad tasted like dish water, which was awkward.  i wouldn't go back, there are so many restaurants in that area to choose from, i recommend choosing another one.",414808
3,"teharu gets three stars for the price, the fact that it has a conveyor belt, and the haru roll-crab salad wrapped in tuna with avocado on top. the sushi is meh, i'm not sure why they have servers, and it's usually a wait but it's good every once in a while",317904

My other rooms get less traffic, and did not need cleaning, since I have been doing my almost daily vacuuming that Eddie suggested last visit.  Daniel and Eduardo came out this time, and there was a call when they were on their way.  They were fair with the pricing as well, since I thought that I had more stairs then I quoted, they adjusted the price, I also received a Yelp discount.  The carpets came out nice, as before, but there was a little less customer service (i.e. no shoe covers, no suggestions for maintenance), but all in all, will be calling again when needed.",221936
3,"Ohhh sweets and bright colors are my weaknesses. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? Yes please! \n\nWalking by the Sugar Factory on the strip was too enticing to pass up. This one, located outside Paris, is a fairly larger candy store then the other two locations (at the Mirage and the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops). \n\nTrue, most everything in here is really overpriced. But there are some cool things to look at. Two pound Reese's peanut butter cup? So tempted to buy. They have some cool novelty items, like couture pops, charm bracelets, hello kitty chocolate bars. I also found some key lime chocolate bars that looked interesting. Sugar factory has their own line of chocolate bars (2 for $5). I ended up picking up a 30 day supply of chocolate squares ($18). The squares are the size you'd see at Ghirardelli, and they come in a variety of flavors (milk, dark, raspberry, smores, caramel). Oh and did I mention cool packaging? It was a gift for my bf, but I'm eating a lot of it. Sharing is caring! =)\nThe chocolates are really good actually. The quality is up and there and the taste is really smooth without being too sweet. \n\nOh and the candy store has a gelato/ice cream shake bar. My friend wanted a scoop of gelato. One scoop is $6. Eeek. And the scoop was tiny! We tried the panna cotta. It was way too sweet! I don't think this place is worth it for a frozen treat fix. I'll pass next time. \n\nWhile I was at the store, I also noticed that it was attached to a dessert boutique. Didn't get to try it, but definitely want to next time. The dessert boutique and the candy store is open 24 hours!",460936

We had to order two since we were at the free variety show so I had the diet coke too. \nVARIETY SHOW: Entertaining with impersonators of Celine Dion, Elvis, Whitney Houston, Garth Brooks, and a comedian. Not a bad show. The theatre is nice and comfy with nice low lighting. \nGAMBLING: Nothing crazy here... I played war and won $18... then went to the slot machines and lost $5.... end of story. \nSERVICE: No complaints here.\nFACILITIES:  I'm not familiar with the casino scene in Arizona but I've been to Vegas and overall seemed like nice facilities but nothing too fancy.\nPARKING: Huge lot but this place gets packed on the weekends so can be hard to find but you'll eventually find a spot. \nCONCLUSION: Nice experience but due to the older crowd probably would not return.....",44776

We have always gotten good service, though, but if its my choice I would not eat here. \n\nThis place has always reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory.

I'm not impressed by their singing talent but they do have impressive piano skills.  The other thing I was impressed by was one of the bartenders here.

Because then I have to wait in line to pee, thinking about how I just paid $5 to stand in line and look at ugly people sitting on splooge covered couches.  \n\nDrink specials and the patio when its not 130 degrees might be appealing if the rest of this nightmare wasnt so fresh in my mind.",101266

2,"After decades of hearing about Carolina's we stopped by. I don't understand what the fuss is all about. If I was in the neighborhood and wanted some Mexican food I would stop in. But it is not worth any kind of drive. There are a hundred Mexican joints in the valley as good or better. I had the flauta special. Nothing special there. Three run of the mill flautas, a quarter cup of beans and a quarter cup of rice. The beans were ok the rice was not worth putting in your mouth. Plus you get to eat off of styrofoam to go boxes. The bean and cheese burro was run of the mill fast food Mexican. The only good thing I can say is the tortillas were above average. We bought a dozen to take home.",28563

4,"I expected the other people in my party to be raving about the eats and drinks we devoured. Apparently, however, our server was the most appetizing element of the entire evening, because that's all they talked about. \n\nI'll admit, even I took a second glance at the clean-shaven stud that took especially careful care of the ladies... and gents, in our group. Dude delivered the goods in style. But, gee, I must've been the only one who was thinking about the meat inside the folds of those tacos after we left. Seriously flavorful delights, folks. Dine on the swine, for sure, it simply knocks the other land-based meats, chicken and steak, out of the water. This goes for the domestic style corn wraps and the crunchy lettuce wraps, equally. Artistically rendered and inspired plates abound at the Mission. And I'll drop a big thumbs up for the kale salad, I thought it was fabulous; this admission surely wins me Metrosexual points, yes? \n\nFinally, the drinks. As a general rule, the further you wander from the familiar path, here, the better. While everyone was quite comforted by the house specialty margarita (and it was tasty), I found much more complexity and delight in the unusual options on the menu. Top it all off with a sitting on the lovely patio, and your Mission, should you choose to accept it, is impeccable.",356374
1,"I was completely disappointed in the quality of the food.  I work downtown and my office mates and I order from Eat quite regularly, but today we were shocked to have received some of the worst food we've ever eaten from Eat.  We ordered both of the chicken sandwiches that are on the limited menu only to discover they were obviously made from frozen chicken breasts that were rubbery and tasted like plastic.  The bread was soggy which, when combined with the disgusting chicken made our sandwiches inedible.  My co worker and I ended up throwing both of our lunches away.  We were also told they no longer are making beignets, which we came to really enjoy.  We vowed never to order from this place again as the food definitely does not match the prices charged, and as there are so many other lunch spots to pick from, we won't miss this eatery.",569232
2,"I'd have to say the best thing they have are nachos and chilli cheese fries. Hot dogs? Eh, pass...\n\nI only went here because I was tired of walking on the strip and hungry in my hotel room.

When my daugher intervened and told the agent \""he told\nyou three times that wed did not want additional coverage\"", the agent told her it was none of her blusiness and if we didn't  like it we could go to another conpany (which we would have if we had not already given them our credit card and drivers license) At this point we asked for the manager on duty (not a significant improvement) and completed our\ntransaction.",372027
1,"Horrible. After hearing so much about Grimaldis and the lack of good pizza on the west side of the Las Vegas valley I thought I'd give it a try since I live less than 2 miles away. While ordering I asked for a side of pizza sauce and they asked if I wanted to come in to pick it up or if I wanted curbside pickup. I asked for curbside. They said 20-25 minutes. I left right away and arrived there 10 mins. after placing my order.  I parked in front and after 5 mins of waiting I decided to go inside. To my surprise it was already at the bar waiting. If it was ready why didn't they check to see if I was there to give me my pizza? And after sitting at the bar for who knows how long the pizza was cold. I got home 24 mins. after ordering my pizza. If I had waited the time they told me I would have picked up an even harder, colder pizza. The sauce was refrigerator cold which was annoying. The pizza was paper plate thin and although I ordered extra cheese it barely had any. I had to reheat the pizza when I got home but even so it was horrible. For $25 the largest pizza they had was so thin that all 8 pieces barely filled my wife and I. Metro pizza is much better and half a pizza fills us both. Will never go there again",502625

2,This place gets two star for the lack of motivation and want to wait on people. How does anyone enter a business and they turn up they nose and treat u like go away. They need lessons on home training and classes on how to treat customers and life lessons on how to treat they fellow man.\n The odd thing is all the people who work here are older they know better. I asked fifty time for help did I get it no. I was getting ready to leave when one lady decided she should at least see what I wanted. I spent 200 with her just to show the others what a little hard work can do. Will I return sadly yes the husband loves this location. Although I cant see for the life of me why,136794
2,"I live right by here so I had high hopes, unfortunately with so many other better Mexican places around town I probably won't be back. \n\nThe carne asada burrito was very light on the meat, and it was a little dry and bland.

3,"Four of us dined on a Sunday evening and left satisfied on the whole. We started with a fish sharing board, which included mackerel, salmon, and I believe trout, along with eggplant slices and other vegetables. Very good starter. My date has this thing about haggis - he has toured all around the UK and tries it wherever it's offered. The verdict was a decent haggis, which I tasted (off the bucket list). I had the chicken wrapped in Parma ham - \""dry\"" was my overall impression. Salads were good.\n\nThe alcohol solution was pretty positive. Innis and Gunn in the bottle, a nice brew indeed. Also very nice scotch. Glenkinchie was the special - loved it.\n\nThe service was polite but a little disorganized.\n\nI was surprised that two reviews were one star. It was not a total disaster like the other reviewers wrote (perhaps they've upped their game in the meantime?) - there was something good for everyone.",557291
1,I went for a nice meal tonight and wound up with a rather bad experience. I first sat in the bar and got a drink. After watching the bartender cater to a group of five while I sat alone and waited 10 minutes for a menu I decided to sit somewhere else in the main dining room.  Kevin then served me. Everything was fine until a party of eight showed up and then he could care less about me and did not show up but once every 20 minutes. Of course when he did come by he wanted to know if I wanted another $20 glass of wine to pump up the bill.  Stay away from this place because the servers just want to make their money on the big parties. And my tip to Kevin showed it. I have been known to tip a lot. Usually 50%. But not tonight and I will not go back. Typical West Coast environment. Short term,190521
1,"Too bad can't indicate zero. Used a Groupon. Food was poor, service indifferent.  Decor takes you back to the 80s but not in a good way (like a banquet hall of a Holiday Inn in Muncie Indiana).

1,"So looking forward to this dining experience last evening...had been recommended by several folks in person and the reviews on Yelp only pumped up my taste buds more...\n\nIf this is Las Vegas Mexican food at it's best then someone needs to have their head examined....it was downright BLAH.\n\nChips and salsa up front was nice touch but Salsa nothing special. Beans were nice free touch too but tasted like straight out of a can. We had several palate's to please. picky 15 year old, 18 year old who loves fish and anything fresh, your texmex appetite and mine who embraces any different, fresh or just darn good food.\n\nHow can you mess up a plain chicken quesadilla... two bites and 15 year old  was done...tasted it and couldn't agree more. Shrimp enchilada sounds good and as there was so much shrimp on the menu you figured it was a easy home run. Chewy and fishy covered in a plain sauce...18 year old didn't get through a 1/4 of it and others at the table agreed. Chicken Enchilada, come on how easy is that...apparently not to easy! Barely passable and again just plain. I had the 3 pork chops, Chuletas was the dish name, marinated overnight in a secret sauce. Don't bother, chops dried out and the sauces only secret is that it smothered the pork chops in something I would only describe as tasteless.\n\nThe service here was excellent (besides 3 requests for water) and can't fault them in this regard. Almost all the people in their, both small and large parties seemed to be celebrating a birthday party and it was just way to loud. WARNING sign - they listed fish on the menu but all they had were shrimp. This leads me to believe they do not shop fresh produce, how can you not have fish tacos on the menu!!! Come on and yes this only dawned on me after.\n\nWe finished our meal and probably returned the food about 75 - 80% untouched. There was an apology from the waiter but no manager to come and ask why, no credit on the bill... NOTHING.\n\nWe left our tip and were out of there and likely to never return...$100 down the drain.\n\nI am rarely this bad when writing reviews but when you have options like Mundos in town and Don Juan for texmex/fresh food then I would recommend you steering clear of this over rated Mexican establishment.\n\nSorry Lindo...",145130
1,"Up until about two months ago I was a big fan of Friday's, especially this location. I went there a couple of months ago and waited at the front. And waited. And waited. There were about ten people waiting to be seated, and we had stood there for nearly 15 minutes. One person wiping tables looked up and saw us all standing there, and went back to wiping tables. We left and went to the hotel buffet.\n\nAbout a month later we went back. No problem getting seated this time. The problem was getting waited on. We sat at the table for nearly 15 minutes and no one approached us. Finally, as we were about to walk out the door, the waitress came by and handed us menus. She said she would be \""right back\"" with our drinks. Another 15 minutes passed (the place wasn't terribly busy). By this time I was fuming - and I'm usually pretty calm and tolerant about these things. Finally - 45 minutes after we were seated - we got to place our order. When the food arrived it was overcooked and dry.\n\nAdd bad service to the significant price increases throughout the Friday's chain ($16.95 for a dish with two pieces of chicken? Really?), and my love affair with Friday's is officially over. When I complained to the company they sent me two $8 dining certificates (which together wouldn't pay for a Jack Daniel's chicken platter). If anyone wants them...",374456
1,"Horrible!!!! We booked through Expedia and when I checked in they didn't have my reservations so they charged my card twice and said one would drop off.

One word GHETTO!!!",130366
2,"Eh...  \n\nMaybe this place is just too sophisticated for my palate.\n\nHubby and I came here for lunch last Monday.  I ordered the Shabu style Hot and Sour soup with tofu, and hubby ordered the sugar cane pork spare ribs and chili lime beef.\n\nThe soup was alright, but not very substantial.  It came with a variety of vegetables, some japanese vegetable I cannot even begin to spell, mushrooms, baby corn, and tomatoes.  I must admit, the hot house tomatoes sort of threw me off.  Because it said Shabu style, i had envisioned something more, more noodles and tofu for dipping perhaps?  Anyway, I definitely would not order that dish again.\n\nThe chili lime beef was actually a beef carpaccio, more lime than chili.  Not that I have anything against carpaccio, but there was nothing on the menu to indicate it would be carpaccio style, and I feel like that is something you should disclose.  \n\nThe sugar cane pork definitely stole the show.  They were tangy and sweet, and extremely tasty.  However one winner out of three just isn't enough to make me want to come back.",351500
5,"The Buffalo serves wings, boneless wings, boneless wings sandwiches, and salads that can be ordered with or without wings.  I like my wings with the bone, otherwise known as tradition wings.  There are some twenty odd flavors.  Currently, I get half hot and half Thai curry.  Top that off with some fries, ketchup, carrots, and blue cheese and you've got yourself a lunch special.  The loyalty card is a nice perk, $5 off every few meals or so.  The servers are very generous with the punches.  And if I ever managed to fill out the survey from the receipt, I would be saving even more moolah.  For a little bit, I was using SCVNGR to unlock some deals.  It is an app that requires you to complete challenges, and if you get enough points, you can unlock deals.  It was fun for a few weeks, but then seemed like a lot of work.  They've also got drinks, but come on, man, this is my lunch break.",478465
1,I had to download the yelp app to my new phone just to explain how horrible this food was. If you pay $7 for a bowl of essentially 'chicken noodle soup' it really should not be a bowl scantily filled with tenden laden crunchy lumps of dark chicken 'meat' and floating pieces of nasty looking chicken skins. There was other random bits oily nasty broth and even though I was told they were going to call my number when ready I had to get tapped by another customer asking me if that was my food sitting on the counter.

5,"I absolutely love this place and truly wished I lived closer. I am a big fan of outdoor malls and there is something for almost everyone here. I say almost because there is only one store that my husband is interested in shopping in. But...this review is about me not him! ;) For me, I love the mix of more well-known clothing stores and local boutiques. I love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as Paradise Bakery, Chipotle, ColdStone Creamery, etc. In the summer, they have the misters going and in the winter, it is the fireplace. There is also a Harkins movie theater. Apart from the middle strip of shops, I like that I can hit up a Target, Ulta, BevMo in one stop. Who cares if I need to drive across the marketplace, the key thing is that I don't have to drive across town to find shops that are all in one place...so convenient. I don't get the parking complaints from other reviewers. How is that the fault of the marketplace? There is an over-abundance of parking spots, but it can be hard to find a spot due its popularity. If you are a bargain shopper, you can go to their website and print out coupons for its shops. My husband and daughter got BOGO frozen yogurt from Mojo Yogurt today. There is also a little splash pad in the middle of the shops that is great for the little ones. This is a great place to cover anything you might need.",290100
5,"This rare, healthy restaurant is hidden from the masses, slot machines and smoke filled Vegas corridors  located near the spa in the Palazzo. Only problem is it's been found, and tons of people were here.

The salad was perfect for lunch and the moist, organic salmon was cooked to perfection.

5,"Just reviewing this club is distracting me enough to lead me off into a hangover daydream... Las Vegas is it's own party bubble atmosphere and XS is definitely one of the highlights of that party. The serene, elegant, lavish, sexy, and bold environment and decor are both refreshing and exciting. It is one of the most spacious and welcoming clubs in LV with a wide indoor dancefloor, VIP seating, and luxurious high ceilings with chandeliers that sparkle with the lighting. But wait until your bright doey eyes behold the outdoor patio equipped with a full poolside bar, beautifully lit, large pool, a lovely nightsky view, and even more space to shake that thang!!! The crowd is a mix of happy party-goers, mostly young in age having a good time. I haven't been there when the pool is open, but I'm excited for that on my next trip.\n\nI don't know how much cover is, but I'm sure it's worth it for the people that have to pay. However, tip for the girls: Talk to the random promoters along the strip because they can get you into clubs (including XS) for free through the guestlist! We even got a few guys in for free. So make sure you spread your social butterfly wings and make friends in Vegas because it pays off! I went to the bar earlier so its wasn't too hard to get a drink, but I saw that it got crowded later in the night, so be prepared. The danclefloor in and out are spacious enough and built in a way to prevent too much cramping and crowding, which is a plus. The bouncers/security are generally nice and helpful, especially considering the crazies and drunks they have to deal with... one of my friends had to be \""politely escorted\"" out.. haha. \n\nXS is definitely one of the lovely gems of Las Vegas, so make sure you show some love and dance moves and pay it a visit. The 5 star ratings speak for themselves! It's definitely a good time baby!",365676
2,"My family got treatments here this weekend and it was a lovely spa. The check in staff was nice enough but we were informed upon checking in that tips were already included on our bills and we couldn't remove them. This kind of turned us off and we inquired about canceling our appointments... they have a 2 day cancellation policy which I think is excessive. So basically we were forced to tip our technicians the amount that MGM wanted them to be tipped, which I didn't think was all that awesome.\n\nThe spa is split into a men's and women's spa but all of the treatment rooms are shared - private, but shared between the two spas. They're well appointed with steam rooms and a large jacuzzi for each one. My dad got a deep tissue and said it was absolutely fantastic. My sister and I got manicures that were good but not worth the $160. We got them on Saturday and it's Tuesday and my polish has almost entirely chipped off! My tech used Seche Vite for the top coat so I know it wasn't that, but she had the balls to dilute the polish she was using on my nails with acetone in front of me... something that makes polish chip. For $160 mani/pedis I thought that was a really crummy way to handle your materials. My technician was sweet though and the actual manicure and pedicure were good. Just bring your own polish and know it's going to be overpriced. Overall I've had better for the steep price but I'd probably go back.",185198

5,"So you get yourself a puppy or an adult dog and you find yourself with two choices.\n\n1. Don't train your dog.

Go to dog training classes. \n\nYeah, number 2 is the right answer. For a very reasonable price ($125) we signed up Anka our brand new 3 month old puppy. Anka is a strong-willed German Shepherd with a high drive and before training was happy to do anything SHE wanted to. After completing our 8 week training class, Anka can now sit, down, wait, stay on command and come when called. She walks on a leash wonderfully now. She doesn't jump up on people any more and she is a lot more comfortable amongst other dogs and people.\n\nLeah is very knowledgeable and patient. She spends time both with the class as a whole and with your dog individually. Every one of the dogs in our class improved dramatically over the course of 8 weeks. The transformation was quite amazing to see.\n\nI picked Leah because of her history with German Shepherds, but she knows about all dogs.

2,"Oh, Westgate Center...\n I live just down the street from this shiny mecca of overpriced, mediocre chains. While I have never attended a sporting event or concert here I do frequent a few of the establishments within this development periodically. If you must eat here I recommend Kabuki (Japanese) or the Yard House (American, upscale pub food with an impressive beer and liquor menu). My boyfriend and I attended the 2011 New Year's Eve event here with a few friends for two reasons: 1)we had just moved here and 2) were too exhausted to do much of anything else. That was a huge mistake! I felt slightly misled as to what we were gaining access to upon paying for admission. Our admission allowed us to only stand in the middle of the common area and listen to a band and pay for a fairly expensive, limited variety of cocktails. All of the bars and restaurants had their own separate cover. Call me crazy, but that seems like a ridiculous business plan. It would have made more sense if they had raised the cover and allowed all of those people to flow freely through the restaurants and bars that Westgate offers. Don't be so stingy Westgate!",270818

1,"I Love dive bars but this one has gotten me questioning the whole concept of it. Firstly it had a cover charge.. Fine it was supposed to have 3 live bands and I understand that we need to pay to see them. THe last band did not show up. WTF!!! they should have told me that at the door. The band that was playing was more interested in fornicating with one groupie that was there. We had to hear a whole monologue from each of the band memebers about how they deserved a dollar stuffed in their whiteys which was fine as long as they actually played a song but nooooo... we will not play until we get a dollar stuffed down our small weenies. \""Then I will give a lap dance to the groupie and still not play\"". \n\nGreat!! and I had to be there to waste my time and money to observe this. Then I hear the last group ain't here. So I basically paid a cover charge to see drunk band members hit on groupies.\n\n And lets not talk about the turd they served me as bar food. The grilled chicken burger turned out to be raw and the soup was well... bleech....\n\nWhy oh why do I subject myself to this mishandling... oh right I like dive bars, food joints etc.... because I believe mom and pop type establishments try their best to serve people well.....\n\nParadigm shift with this establishment... service was apathetic.. food well.... grungy... and music..... blase....\n\nTruly a disappointment to my core beliefs",33695

3,"Honestly I wasn't impressed. I've been to fantastic sushi restaurants including Nobu in NYC, so maybe I have high standards, but the way I like sushi is when you actually can be impressed by the quality of the fish. Unfortunately, the specialty rolls that Cyros offers seems to cover up the taste of the fish. Their most popular roll, the Cyros Avante Garde, had fried shallots and garlic on top...way too much garlic flavor for sushi. I will say the service is friendly and they have a good selection of sake. Other than that, the atmosphere is not so great...head to Roosters next door for a better atmosphere. Otherwise if you're looking for sushi that actually tastes like sushi, head over to Yama or Ru San's.",426035

Also, the service was okay...nothing spectacular but not the worst I've had.\n\nThe second time they were short handed in the front of house. The service was appalling.

I asked if it was alright to pick up the car earlier than the reservation without any extra charges and they said it was fine and I already reserved the car for the extra hours (supposedly). I put a $27 insurance on top of for the day, thinking it was a simple $27 charged. A $92 total balance for the rental for one day in Vegas wasn't too bad. THING AGAIN! I was billed an extra $114! For a total of $186 for ONE DAY! I argued with the manager who gave a \""I could care less\"" attitude and said the extra charges where a 40% tax on top of other fee's in relation to the insurance I accepted and the EXTRA HOURS.

HORRIBLE LYING CUSTOMER SERVICE, CRUEL ATTITUDE TO ANY OF YOUR NEEDS, AND OUTRAGEOUS HIDDEN FEE'S",268654

3,"I enjoyed the Paris, but I find it to be quite overpriced.  I would easily give it 4 stars if it were less for the cost.  \n\nThe rooms were pretty standard, but the real star of Paris is the buffett.  The gaming floor is also large and easy to navigate.",161547
1,"For the past few years, my employees and I attend an annual conference at the MGM Grand and I take the dozen or so employees to lunch at the Rainforest cafe--not anymore! The food and service this past week when we dined was awful!! It took nearly an hour to get our tasteless, mediocre and overpriced food. If you are looking for good food and service, go to another restaurant and avoid the Rainforest cafe at the MGM!!!",137395
2,"Originally, I was in love with this place. I have lived here going on my 5th month. In the beginning, they were generous and extremely satisfactory. Now that I've actually been through hell with them, my opinion has completely changed. When they went to go deposit a check I had written to them, they ended up getting all screwed up in the office and deposited two checks (one post-dated for a few weeks following) - This withdrew my account and I ended up speaking to the property manager and everything seemed handled, right? I think not. I go in to pay my rent and its an extra $70+ dollars added to my account. MY question -Why?! According to the property manager, who of course just had to intervene, the account charges were only covered to a point... SO, you're trying to tell me that because of your mistake I have to pay EVEN MORE? Excuse me, but that is not my error nor am I at fault. Then, she had the nerve to tell me to \""check\"" my attitude - all the while she was giving me attitude. WELL, if that is the way you want to treat your residents who can, for example, just go and log onto Yelp! and write of all the horrid experiences they have, they go right on ahead. The secondary problem I have with this place is that I was sent a check in the mail to cover my tuition and \""the new post office guy\"" checked it in twice as delivered, and its NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. Again, Miss Property Manager just said \""It is not my problem.\"" and \""You are the third person who has come to me with this issue.\"" How am I supposed to feel comfortable about receiving confidential and pertinent mail? \n\nI hate writing all this bad things about Lakeview because, really, I love my 2bd/2ba apartment, I love the pool and the complex is absolutely beautiful! But I have been left with no choice at this point! I am so aggravated and disgusted about the way I have been treated. And my real issue is that NO ONE is going to do anything about it!",114563
2,"For all the hype this place did not live up to my expectations. The service was good but the kitchen clearly lost our order as the table that was seated 20 minutes after us received their entrees before we did (both tables ordered sandwiches). In the end the wait was not worth it as I only finished half my sandwich and fries. There are excellent places to eat in Vegas, however this is not one of them.",461199

It is a bit on the pricey side though.",132247

I think they should be more excited about they are producing.",513956

Plenty of room at the bar, we all ordered drinks, then were seated within 5 minutes. \n\nWe ordered the corn dip to start, still delicious. I tried the Farmhouse burger and it was AWESOME!!! The tomato jam really made it special, as well as the fried green tomato on top (and of course, don't forget the bacon!).\n\nWere ordered small orders of all the fries to share and they were delicious, as usual. The service was prompt and attentive. I'd love to try this place for brunch some day!",572821
1,"There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""rewards\"" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them.",42781
4,"A must try just for the atmosphere! My husband and I, I would say, have just aged-out of the target demographic of this place. We actually brought our baby (as I said, just aged-out, so new baby must come along on vacations) and it was super chill. While there was no sitting inside, the outside was a lovely Phoenix evening with a lovely crowd of folks. \n\nWe tried out pastries and coffee drinks. The pastries--Red Velvet Cake and Lemon Bar--I wanted to love because they came on adorable mismatching china, but at that late hour they had unfortunately staled. \n\nBut the coffee! I had a decaf Americano and it was maybe the best coffee I've ever had. And to be honest, decaf is never good. It's just something to sip on whole others have a cocktail. This decaf, though...\n\nMy husband waited in the epic cocktail line (separate from the food/coffee drink line) and asked the bartender to surprise him with something coffee-based. He was served some kind of masterpiece of spirits and freshly-pulled espresso, complete with thoughtful aromatic garnishes. Again, rocking coffee.",152187
5,"Came here after reading several great reviews on yelp. This is my my first time in Vegas and the first meal I had here and man oh man it was AMAZING!!!

My partner had the All American Classic which he loved as well. \nThe service was fabulous despite being packed and even allowed me to change my skinny fries to sweet potato fries a few minutes after I ordered without a hiccup. They had a great service where instead of just waiting they just messaged us when our table was free and we were seated 2 minutes after we put our names down. \nWill we come back here? Definitely!!",155697

I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and it came out PINK...PINK as in undercooked and totally overpriced.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.

I got a better deal eating at the signatures with an all american breakfast platter that costs $11.  \n\nIf you are coming here to find some great steals on mom and pop style off the strip hidden gems, and this is definitely the wrong place.

Guess our business and pleasant attitude just wasn't serious enough for him. \n\nWent here because it had such great yelp reviews and thought it was the best place to start our wedding suit shopping 3 months before the big day!\n\nUnfortunately we were told that this is NOT the first place to go by the OWNER himself. Apparently he wanted us to shop around at all the other suit places so they could do all the work of having us try suits on and he could skip out on it. He wouldn't even allow us to try on a suit!!!  He said \""It just takes so much time with people coming in and trying suit after suit on\"". Man that poor guy owning a suit shop, who knew people would actually want to try them on? \n\nSo the customer service is non-existent unless you're willing to walk in and know exactly what you want right away. I'm not sure if he thought we weren't serious about buying suits or that we could afford it.

It was perfect for our party of six, four adults and two children.  \n\nWe ordered our favorite the Fat Greek Combo, Zeus & Athena Beers and by recommendation from Jennica, the Greek Fries and  Flaming Feta, of course chicken tenders and spaghetti for the kids. The combo is huge, the fries indescribably delicious and just saying flaming feta makes my mouth water.  The kids...and adults loved the flaming presentation.\n\nJennica took very good care of us, the manager on duty even checked on our table and the owner Demetri stopped by too.  This staff obviously cares about the dining experience of their patrons!\n\nWe ate till our hearts and stomachs were content, who am I kidding, they were joyful!  And if that wasn't enough Jennica brought us out a dessert that was obviously created for a Greek God or at least a demigod or two. I'll do my best to describe in mortal words, vanilla ice cream sprinkled with cinnamon sat atop fried sweet bread with honey and whipped cream.  It was incredible.\n\nDefinitely sit on the patio and ask for Jennica, you won't be sorry.  Maybe a little stuffed, but not sorry at all!",201788

3,"I'm basing my review solely on the club and not the terrible bouncers and security outside. They seriously made our lives hell considering the fact that we got bottle service. We had a group of about 20 but six of us went in 5 mins after the rest of our group because we had to use the bathroom. Security was well aware of this by the way. Once we got back from the bathroom, a security guard yelled at us for not having a stamp even though he knew we were in the bottle service group. We dropped $1600 to get yelled at? Screw you police academy drop out, get a real freaking job. \n\nNow for the club. We had an amazing time overall, even though our waitress was a joke. I've had better servers at a Denny's restaurant who don't get $300 tips. The DJ was great and the club had an awesome atmosphere. We literally were dancing at least 97% of the time and a good time was had by all. I seriously recommend that the management retrain their security and servers though. They should be happy to have groups of people drop their hard-earned money during this economy.",184825

I work about a block away, so it's a great place to grab a bite, and they usually can get you in and out of there in an hour.  So far I have tried the black bean veggie burger and the Caprese sandwich, both are delicious! They have wedge and sweet potato fries which makes it really hard to choose, but after trying both I prefer the wedge fries which is surprising for me, but they're really that good!  Yesterday the table next to me ordered the mac n cheese, it looked fantastic! I'll be giving that a try soon.  The girls and I decided to splurge at lunch yesterday and ordered the red velvet cake.  I'm not a huge cake fan, but this was very moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. Another quick tip for switch... they take reservations, even for lunch!",279401

1,"We just moved in together after my Girlfriend/fiance lived here for over a year. She said it they used to care about their customers. \n\nManagement knew you by name, issues were resolved, and the grounds were well kept. \n\nWe have been here since Mid May 2012 and have had nothing but issues with the staff, and requests for repairs. The Repair staff is phenominal. The process to get the simplest request done takes 2-3 times as long usually due to management dropping the ball.\n\nWe made a payment on time through their system and it not only posted late we got to pay an additional 100 bucks in fees, which the office would not bother crediting even though it was their error. There bill pay switched over and after speaking directly with their systems operator/company they verified it was their error. But we were still out an extra 100. \n\nWe were up front with them about two pets moving in. We told them we would not renew if our pets weren't allowed. We were told by management everything was fine. Two months into the lease and only after we were attacked by a neighbors dog, my hand and my smaller dogs face, resolved, not on the leash and not even listed on the property, we received a notice of unauthorized dogs on the property. After confronting the office it turns out they messed up but we now get to pay an additional 51 a month. Even though according to our agreement that cost is already factored in... \n\nNeedless to say after numerous headaches with the office staff having very poor customer service, after ripping us off, we are now seeking legal action to garner back our costs spent and have also contacted The Better Business Bureau. \n\nI would not recommend this property to anyone. The cabinets are cheap, the appliances in the kitchen were new, the dryer and washer were old. Stains on carpet when we moved in and after requesting a price to replace we were quoted over 900 dollars out of pocket to replace carpet we were renting. \n\nThe grounds are well kept, and the community is really sketchy, I have seen a man pummel a women and after I threatened him to lay off her he just flat out said \""I don't care, seems to be the slogan of the Broadstone Ahwatukee Fairways.

4,"Okay, I live up the street. I remember when this was a small, open air mall. Times have changed. It's huge. It has everything from sports memorabilia to Italian fashion. It's a place where I like to people-watch. I'm not a big customer here because the place just has a bit too much of the \""Snottsdale\"" feeling to it. By that I mean people trying to impress each other and themselves. They never buy much, but they walk around with their noses in the air. That's okay. It's the culture of Scottsdale and I accept that. It is fun to sit down and observe and listen in on the one-upmanship that goes on. \n\nI patronize many of the companies that are represented at SFS, just not there. I waled into one store for an item I knew they carried. The sales girl had no clue. I pointed to it and she picked up the wrong one. They have an AT&T store which is virtually bare of products. Why? But this isn't a criticism of the mall, but of Scottsdale and this mall gives Scottsdale what it wants: Image and little substance. \n\nBut that's the community this mall serves and it's a good fit. I don't need to pay to see the circus when I can come here for free. It's just plain amusing.",159146

It was a huge wrap, but not very tasty. I ate one third of it. The baked beans and potatoes salad were not very good either. I regret not having just plain chicken or ribs. They looked and smelled good. I'm not sure that I will go back because the television was on Fox News. I could never sit through that again. Public places should never have televisions on stations that may offend their customers. It would have been better to have it off.",74394

The chicken quesadilla is great, and their nachos are served as individual chips piled with meat and cheese on them, sort of unique.

3,"Heart Attack Grill is a hamburger joint with a zany parallel universe hospital theme.  Waitresses dress in somewhat provocative nurse outfits (The type of nurse outfits you'll see in fantasy playbacks in movies with everything all boosted up and sticking out).  Following the theme, each customer is required to wear hospital gowns upon entrance.  Their burger is eloquently named the \""bypass\"" and depending on the number of patties it'll be the single, double, triple, quadruple (more if you'd like...) \""bypass\"".  \n\nWhen a place is called heart attack anything, it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question.  Parodied movie posters are plastered all over the walls.  While I'm no Jason Bourne, I always do a scan of any place I go too before settling in my seat.  Here my sights stopped on a rather large scale.  Above the scale was an indicator pronouncing whoever weighs 350 lbs, WILL EAT FREE!  First off, if you weigh that much, eating here may be hazardous to your health.  I was lucky enough to see a fellow customer climb onto that scale and \""win\"" a free meal.  Sirens went off with applause following.  \n\nA close buddy from L.A. had been talking about trying this place out on a couple occasions.  The three of us looking at menus in hospital gowns was a sight to see.  After a couple chuckles we ordered.  The smallest of the group ended up ordering the triple bypass while I chickened out and got the double.  We all shared a side of chili cheese fries which could have fed five or more easily.  Sizes are massive and while I did finish most of it; I don't think it was a particularly good idea.  Splicing chili on top of each burger patty inserted another layer of taste to a burger that consisted mainly of overly greasy meat flavor.  Take out the notion I was clogging my arteries at an exponential rate after each bite, the burger was ok.    \n\nThe novelty of it all is an experience in itself.  Seeing a couple Japanese tourists being spanked by the nurse waitresses is another interesting sight.  Rule is if you don't finish, you get spanked.  I'm assuming this was optional since any normal human would assuredly have trouble finishing these burgers and not everyone got spanked.  Aligning their extreme gimmick with the same motto of a more adult Hooter's equating to more show than emphasis on food, Heart Attack Grill is worth at least ONE visit.  I don't know about a second.  My heart may not be able to handle it.",530519
4,"We were seated right away around noon on a Sunday, the service was fast and concise, and the food came fast. There was not a huge selection of carts, but almost everything we had was up to dim sum standards and great. The shrimp balls were excellent, and the \""deep fried dumplings\"" were amazing--we think they had pork in them, but either way they were great. Definitely easy, delicious, and very typical for dim sum. We will definitely go there again, but it wasn't quite as good as our Chinatown place we used to go to in Atlanta.",123792
4,Only had soup and salad and it is hard to mess it up but the soup (lentil) was delicious and most importantly it was hot. The house salad was adaquate.  Service was friendly and timely. I would recommend this bistro for its price and food,21818
1,Can't do all you can eat by yourself. Seems unfair to pay more for just a single item on the menu when I couldn't get someone to join me and get the 15.99 price.,63964
2,"To me Outback Steakhouse is on par with Applebee's or TGIFriday's - nothing special.\n\nThe food is okay, the atmosphere is okay, the service is okay. \n\nA friend of mine loves this place so the boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We all ordered steak. I ordered the outback special - a 6 oz steak with your choice of two sides - I chose fries and veggies. You get all this for $10. And guess what? It tastes like a $10 steak. I guess I've been spoiled at places like Mastro's and Morton's because this steak was not even in the same galaxy as steaks from those places. But it was $10 so I wasn't expecting it to be the best steak I've ever had either. Honestly, for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay. In retrospect I with I would have shelled out a few more bucks, maybe I would have gotten something a little better.\n\nAll in all, Outback isn't horrible, it's just not great. It's a chain and you get what you pay for.",48270
1,"They do a great job with their work however I feel like I am just another person interrupting their day when I walked in.  No questions asked, just \""grab your nail polish color\"" and that's about it.  Would like some attention to the customer as this was the case with others too.",257036
3,The hotel has great location at the middle of the strip with access to the monorail. Entrance was hard to find. Cafe waiting staff sucks. ghe Buffet was surprisingly good with great service staff.,129030
1,I am so upset to come here and place such a large order late at night with no one really there so obviously it shouldn't be that hard to get the order right. \n\nIt's another fast food spot that you don't expect customer service from but the least they could do is get the order right. I call to speak to a manager who Ofcourse doesn't speak English that well and if she does she sure didn't sound like it on the phone.  \n\nAs she sat there telling me what she did to our order I'm explaining to her that it's wrong with missing items she talks over me to correct me. I will never understand how such people are hired to run a store. I'll be calling again in the morning in hopes I talk to someone who understands customer issues.,60199
4,"So I really wanted to Yelp something today. So, a buddy (@groovypucks) and I went to Thai Lahna.  I noticed it had a LOT of reviews and still maintained a pretty reputable score!  Hey, its only a block or two from work, so why not?\n\nWe get there and are immediately seated which in my opinion is rare.  For the rave reviews, I noticed it was kind of 'dead' for a lunch crowd.  A few old people and the owners were all I really noticed.  We get a booth seat (I love booth seats.  If I could work, sleep and eat in a booth seat, I would die a happy man) so I am already getting excited.  Groovypucks and I take way too long looking at the menu and finally decide on our dishes (which we accompanied with a Thai Tea).  I asked to make my curry spicy(#36 Yellow Curry Chicken with Green Beans), and it WAS!  Almost too spicy, but I attribute that to my lack of experience with their dishes.  If I were to order it again, I would order it medium.\n\nGroovy got a Peanut and Chicken dish (#35) with onions and peppers.  I tried a bit, as I am comfortable in my sexuality, and I really liked it.  It was Damn good! That's right, Capital D!  The service for the rest of the meal was below par, but not to the point that it was annoying.  It just took a little too long to get my food and my check at the end...\n\n...And with this review I leave you with my fortune\n\nIf strength were all,\ntiger would not fear scorpion.",24280
2,"This is a very small Irish pub.  The set up is relatively nice, despite its small size.  However, the location had a poor beer selection when we visited and appeared to be out of at least 3 of their draft selections. For well drinks, my girlfriend typically drinks vodka and cranberry and noted that their pour was very weak on vodka.",2804
5,This place is great! The only downside is that it is 40 minutes from my house. I wish it was closer. Really nice and affordable outdoor range. The people there are really friendly.,441200
5,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! It has fast service and super great food. I've been to other pho joints but their pho broth doesn't even compare. Also they give hugh sides of all the extras that go in the soup.,61996
5,"Margherita Pizza! Best one on the menu. I also love the white pizza. They have an amazing Bellini here as well. This place reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples, Italy! Enjoy!",623412
5,"Great meal. Started with the \""garbage Caesar \"" loaded with shrimp. House specialty Osso Bucco perfect, loaded with marrow. Freddie is a great host. Try his special post dinner shot!",128247
5,"Leah is so FANTASTIC with dogs ! Our Great Dane and *little buddy* Diesel is now a good boy and plays nice with others dogs. I don't usually write these but, I just had to here because Dog House Training Academy is so good at what they do. I highly recommend Puppy 101, Intermediate and Advanced. The results will amaze !",414435
5,"Wow.  Totally engrossing.  Unbelievable staging (I won't give it away, but it is extraordinary).  A constant parade of amazing physical feats.  Fabulous use of the theater for theater-in-the-round staging.  [Apologies - have run out of adjectives.]\n\nA typically odd Cirque storyline that is somewhat difficult to follow, and lagged a couple of times, but the action was sustained and kept me holding my breath for oh, roughly, 90 minutes!!\n\nHands down recommendation to see it.  Very, VERY well done.\n\nNote: saw this Dec 2009.",181994
4,"Mm, I'd like to give it 3.5 stars.  \n\nBacchanal Buffet is in Ceasar's Palace, beyond the casino and near the desserts cafe. You can't miss it, it's where the HUGE line is.  We must have gotten there by 12pm and didn't get seated for another 1hour and 40 minutes.  line was crazy.  We got there and ordered the bottomless mimosas, which end at 3pm. We paid about $41.99 for Sunday's lunch.  \n\nThere was a good variety of food there. There's asian foods in the back (sushi, peking duck, ramen, udon noodle soup, etc), then cheese and charcuterie, pizza and pasta (the meatballs were really good), then there's your mexican/latino station (it's more like a taco station), BBQ station (some were really dry. I got the ribeye and that was juicy but really fatty), french fries and tator tots (sweet potatoe tots were really good), then lastly, your seafood station. The seafood station had snow crabs, oysters, and shrimp. I wanted to see some more stuff like lobster tails, maybe steamed mussels, but none of those were available.  \n\nSalad station was limited but I liked the garbanzo salad and the japanese seaweed salad.  \n\nDessert station was AWESOME. get the lava chocolate chip cookie, mochi ice creams, and coconut macaroons. So good. We also got a ice cream cone on the way out of the buffet.  I highly recommend it, it was a good experience and worth the wait.",570054
2,"By far, the worst Greek food that I have ever had.  Granted my experiences are based mostly in Chicago (as well as Greece, NYC, etc.) but still!\n\nI ordered spicy hummus as an appetizer.  It was neither spicy nor that great of hummus.  It was the second course that made me realize that I was in for a bad meal.  My greek salad was an iceberg lettuce with some feta cheese on top.  It did not taste like a greek salad to me.  My entree, shrimp with vegetable skewers tasted really bland.  \n\nI did enjoy sitting al fresco facing the fountain.  It was the best part of the experience.",273931
5,"I took my girlfriend here for Thanksgiving. 2014. We both love prime rib and had never been here . It was a great experience ! From the service to the food. Only thing we didn't care for is the spinning salad. It has a 1,000 island base and we are Roquefort fans. But the prime rib and turkey were off the hook ! Great restaurant experience",137881
4,"I have been to Mi Patio a couple times in the past, but it has been a few years since then. After seeing so many positive reviews & recs on the place I knew I had to come back & refresh my memory of Mi Patio. \n\nMy dad & I came here for lunch this past Wednesday around noon. The parking lot was packed, that's always a good sign! I have to agree with Rand H, that the restaurant does have an odd shape to it. We were seated at a table that had a chair on one side & a booth on the other, I sat at the booth spot. Our table was kinda wobbly, definitely needed to stick a book or something under the table leg. \n\nChips & salsa were immediately brought out & soon after came our drink orders. The chips & salsa were pretty damn good & our server was very on top of refills. For our entrees: my dad ordered a bean & cheese burro & I ordered the baja spinach & feta cheese chimi, both came with a side of rice. Dad enjoyed his burro & ate about 3/4 of it, he didn't eat the rice though because he's more of a beans guys & is watching his carbs. I also enjoyed my chimi, very unique flavors, the rice was yummy & I finished it all. I had about half of my chimi left so I took it home to hubby, along with the rest of my dad's burro & his rice. Hubby said chimi was ok, rice was good & burro was his fav. \n\nMy next visit will for sure be sooner than a few years!",92689
4,"This place is great. Best mofungo ever --- the mound was textured with crispy, fried pieces of plantain integrated within the traditional mashed up plantain chunks. I could eat that all on its own. I ordered it with the fried pork chop, which came with the traditional gravy --- delicious. The maduros and boiled yucca were prepared just the way I like it. The garlic sauce for the yucca was potent . . . but again, that's just the way I like it.",347847
5,"I'm usually pretty wary of places that are \""hyped up\"" by the yelp community, cause more often than not they actually suck, but this place is actually good, surprisingly so.\n\nIt's called Secret Pizza because there's no flashing lights and a million advertisements pointing to the place. Which I'm sure they think is very edgy, but I just enjoy watching idiot tourists walk around searching in desperation for a sign to show them the way. Think you're in the wrong city for that.\n\nThe wait was a little long, but it was reasonable considering the high volume of shmoozies that were there. My friends and I stick to our traditional and delicious plain cheese pizza, and it was large and awesome. Not too greasy, a very generous size for a large, and the price is right.",495894
5,"I love Mandalay Bay! \n\nWhen you walk through the doors you get a whiff of a fresh breezy tropical lotiony scent . Located on the strip one of the first hotels you come across. Delano is also a part of mandalay. There are a great selection of shops... Lush is here too! \n\nThere is a tram or indoor walk route that leads you to Luxor Excalibur New York New York. \n\nRooms have tubs which I like. They have a cardio exercise room downstairs that's open to guests but the gym is part of the spa and they charge a fee for daily access. \n\nThere is a chapel, food court with subway etc, shark reef aquarium that's about $18-20 per person\n\nMy favorite thing about MB is their pools. Wave pool, lazy river pool with waterfalls. The best during the summer.\n\nLight is also here too.",172031
1,"My guests and I were seated and we asked for bread, as one couple had just gotten off a plane and they  were starved.  We got it 20 minutes later after asking 3 more times and threatening to leave.\n\nThe Calamari appetizer was the worst ever.  50% of the plate (not exagearting) was old breading, and the calamari was tough and overcooked.\n\nI ordered the Shrimp Risotto, which used to come with shrimp and scallops.   No more scallops.  But of course they raised the price on the dish anyway.   Welcome to new American dining.   Cut the food.  Raise the prices.\n\nBrio presents a nice atmosphere because it was physically well designed.  Problem is, they forgot to hire anyone who can cook or provide nice table service.",387677
5,"I am often very nervous about visiting a new salon, I've been doing my own (ethnic) hair for many years. I worked in this area, and heard a lot of buzz about a fabulous stylist named Holly. I consulted with her and booked an appointment, she did an outstanding job! I even brought my son back for a kid cut! The girl's got skills and a great personality to match. I have recommended her to quite a few of my friends, stop by and check her out! :-)",559297
1,"They don't deserve to use the words \""dim sum\"" in their name!!  This is not a dim sum place at all!!  A few dim sum items under the appetizer section of their menu does not do it!!  Who ever heard of $18 for a bowl of pho?!!  We didn't order that but wanted to note how ridiculous that was - only in Vegas, I guess!!  We had their wonton noodle soup, which was $12, and not spectacular!  We ordered the hau gow and sue mai just to try it and it was dry and not worth it at all!!  The service was super slow and the servers all looked miserable!  Worse place ever, not worth a dime!!!",329447
3,"Luxor- from the hotel registration, go up the escalator to the right. We needed a quick bite to eat before our flight. \n\nShared the Chicken Nachos... $15! With tax and tip, we just left a $20. \nThey were pretty good nachos and a good sharing size but way too expensive for  nachos. Glad they were pretty good but wouldn't come back.",357189

5,Best boba in town!\n\nThis is a very unique Tea bar. You come in thinking your getting some tea and you end up getting Teazed! Lol\nThis is your classic tea joint but you're served by good looking half naked Asian woman. So get it: cafe Teaze? Hahaha!!! I knew you would. \n\nThe drinks are very well flavored. I personally like hot almond milk tea. But they have all types of boba. \n\nThe owners are cool too. Laid back and down to earth. \nCome in and support this great local business.,618172
2,"I have been coming to xtreme bean for several years and it is still a generally good place.  the coffee is average or below, the tea selection is good, the atmosphere is ok but same old.

I'll have to think twice about coming back if this continues.",48768
1,"Horrible landlord, is always in a bad mood never shows up when she says she will. Will schedule an appointment and not show up and then will blame you when you question why she hasn't come yet. Horrible on respecting privacy will schedule maintenance before even telling you and will expect you to be fine with whatever date and time and when you need something done actually maintenance will take weeks if not months to do the job. \n\nDo not rent from these people unless you are a masochist.",87737
3,"Not a coffee drinker...but:\n\nI like the space, I like the comfy seating and the plethora of outlets to plug in computers, and of course the free internet.

1,"Ummmmm....yuck.  Just \""yuck\"".\n\nI mean, seriously?  I give it one star because the waitress was nice and we got good service.\n\nWe were here last week.  Wife got her birthday \""grand slam\"".  OMG...I don't know what they did but it was disgusting.  The pancakes tasted heavy and fat and, well, just \""yucky\"".  They should have been \""light and fluffy\"", as most breakfast places will make them.  Eggs weren't a lot better.  I wouldn't be surprised if eating that shaved a year or two off her life.  It was free for her birthday, and I still think we got ripped off on that one!\n\nI had a burger and fries.  Well...they were better than McDonald's.  Can't say they were bad.  But definitely nothing special.  You could make a better one in your own kitchen in about 10 minutes for a fraction of the cost.  If you want a decent burger try Fuddruckers or Red Robin or someplace like that.  For the price, Denny's burger was definitely not worth it.\n\nI don't care if it's free on your birthday, it's not worth it.  Don't come here.",429120

3,Food isn't that good. Don't know why people love it so much. The customer service is okay but they are quite and don't really talk. My favorite thing is the ice tea wow it's amazing! But other then that it's cool. An upgraded KFC with not  a lot of stuff on the menu.,524389
3,"Think of the Sugar Factory as a beddazzled Cheesecake Factory on steroids. It's got a large menu with just about everything on it. But, I can't tell you if it's good or bad because I only stopped by for a couple sweet treats with the family.\n\nThis place is actually broken up into four sections. The Sugar Factory American Brasserie is for dining, either indoors or on their patio overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountains. The Sugar Factory Chocolate Lounge is a more intimate space with sweets and drinks. The Outdoor Caf\u00e9, located right on the Strip, is a small outdoor counter serving up sandwiches, ice cream, gelato and other sweets. Finally, the Sugar Factory retail shop is the place to get sweets and merchandise (similar to their other shops around the Strip).\n\nThe retail shop was sensory overload -- not only with the desserts, cookies, ice cream, and gelato, but also with all the crap, I mean merchandise, to buy. Plus, the place was packed with tourists. Not the place to be if you hate crowds (as I do). We purchased three items (for around $12) and found a small, quiet 4 seat counter near the Chocolate Lounge to relax.\n\nThe wife got a peanut butter cookie that she called average (and not enough peanut butter). The kid got a small cup of chocolate ice cream, which he loved. He's 3, so of course he wasn't picky about his ice cream.\n\nI went with a key lime cupwich. It's a great -- albeit old -- concept that I'm surprised hasn't caught on with more cupcake shops. They take the bottom half of the cake portion of the cupcake and put it on top of the icing, making a sandwich. I'm a huge fan of the concept. Their version allows for a better icing-to-cake ratio and is easier to eat than most cupcakes. It looked beautiful with additional icing garnishing the top, along with a sugar-made flower and some sprinkles. It had a strong key lime flavor without being too tart. Unfortunately, the cake part was dry. \n\nI'd possibly come back to try other sweets. Maybe even the food. But, if you just want desserts I'd recommend heading to Jean Philippe Patisserie at Aria or Bellagio before this place.",504446
3,"This would be a great place to watch a game. The food is kinda overpriced...but decently good. The traditional wings are my favorite, Asian Zing and Medium with a side of Ranch! \n\nIf you're going to order an appetizer, stick with the fried pickles. They're the only thing that's marginally different from something you could get pretty much anywhere else.",544799
5,"During a extended layover at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, I searched for the closest vegan hot spot. I saw that Green had many outstanding reviews. So I headed over in a cab.\n\nAfter chatting with the staff, I ordered a black jack pita.

And it was far better than anything I could have hoped to order at an airport. So it was well worth the trip.",111784

3,"My dogs and I go to Cosmos often, with mixed experiences.  Like any dog park, we've run into some clueless jerks who don't pick up after their dogs (why is it always that giant mastiff taking a dump the size of my arm?) and don't control their animals.  I've been jumped on by Yorkies and Pitbulls alike...Cosmos takes all kinds.  Same as any bark park -- watch your dog like a hawk to make sure they're minding their manners and protect them from potentially aggressive dogs with your calm, assertive energy.\n\nThe thing that blows my mind about Cosmos is that people let their kids play there...it's a DOG playground not a CHILD playground.  I was there on Veteran's Day and there were a couple of moms who were letting their babies play in the gravel by the water like it was a day at the shore.  IT IS NOT A REAL BEACH PEOPLE!!!  It is a giant toilet for dogs. You might as well have your kid build a sand castle in a litter box or let them eat their Teddy Grahams off a pooper scooper.",237678
